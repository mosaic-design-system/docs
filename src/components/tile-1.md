    body: "## What is a Tile?


      **Tiles** are customisable buttons, with a larger centralised icon
      and title text underneath. Tiles are 150px by 150px with an icon size of
      64px by 64px.

      ## When, and why?


      **Tiles** can be used to build a user-friendly interactive screen,
      providing easy to use navigation. You can use **Tiles** to build things
      like home screens and dashboards on both mobile and desktop devices, and
      they are also great for acting as large navigation links elsewhere in the
      application.

      ## Types of Tile


      There are two types of **Tile** available for use:\ 


      | Type | Description |

      | --- | --- |

      | Default  |  Used for data visualisation and assembling a dashboard
      - the default type has an icon and text that can be used for desktop and
      other larger devices |

      | Title Tile  | These are similar to the standard Tile, but they
      don't have an icon and require less space - perfect for users that are
      using a device with a smaller amount of space  |

      ## Using a Tile


      ### Tile labels


      All **Tiles** should have a label, **just like Buttons**. Make sure
      you use an informative label that describes where it will take the user,
      and be mindful of keeping it concise. You can check out the
      [Structure](guidelines/style-guide/#structure) section of the Style Guide
      for more help on creating appropriate headings and labels.


      Labels in the **Tile** should also be centrally aligned.


      ### Tile icons


      Similarly, the icon in a **Tile** should be centrally aligned.\ 


      The icons are set to a height and width of 48px, and should use the
      icons from the [Icons8 icon
      library](https://mosaic-icon-search.oneadvanced.io/).


      ### Number of Tiles


      We don't have a limit on the number of **Tiles** that you can use on
      a page, but you should consider the amount of options you give to a user.
      There is a risk of overusing **Tiles** and presenting the user with too
      many options and making it difficult for them to find what they need.
      Context is important in this instance, and you should use your best
      judgement to balance the usefulness of **Tiles** with the usability of
      your application."
