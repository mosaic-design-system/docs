    body: "## What is a Tile?


      **Tiles** are customisable buttons, with a larger centralised icon
      and title text underneath. Tiles are 150px by 150px with an icon size of
      64px by 64px.

      ## When, and why?


      **Tiles** can be used to build a user-friendly interactive screen,
      providing easy to use navigation. You can use **Tiles** to build things
      like home screens and dashboards on both mobile and desktop devices, and
      they are also great for acting as large navigation links elsewhere in the
      application.

      ## Types of Tile


      There are two types of **Tile** available for use:\ 


      | Type | Description |

      | --- | --- |

      | Default  |  Used for data visualisation and assembling a dashboard
      - the default type has an icon and text that can be used for desktop and
      other larger devices |

      | Title Tile  | These are similar to the standard Tile, but they
      don't have an icon and require less space - perfect for users that are
      using a device with a smaller amount of space  |

      ## Using a Tile


      Using tiles\r

      \r

      •\tBoth the icon and label should be centrally aligned

      \r

      \r

      •\tIcons are set to a height and width of 48px and can be found
      using the Icons8 icon library


      •\tTiles should be used with caution of risk of overusing, an easy
      to use navigation system is better for the user than too many tiles.


      ### Tile labels


      All **Tiles** should have a label, **just like Buttons**. Make sure
      you use an informative label that describes where it will take the user,
      and be mindful of keeping it concise. You can check out the
      [Structure](guidelines/style-guide/#structure) section of the Style Guide
      for more help on creating appropriate headings and labels.


      Labels in the **Tile** should also be centrally aligned.


      ### Tile icons


      Similarly, the icon in a **Tile** should be centrally aligned.\ 


      The icons are set to a height and width of 48px, and should use the
      icons from the [Icons8 icon
      library](https://mosaic-icon-search.oneadvanced.io/)."
