    body: "## What is a Tile?


      **Tiles** are customisable buttons, with a larger centralised icon
      and title text underneath. Tiles are 150px by 150px with an icon size of
      64px by 64px.

      ## When, and why?


      **Tiles** can be used to build a user-friendly interactive screen,
      providing easy to use navigation. You can use **Tiles** to build things
      like home screens and dashboards on both mobile and desktop devices, and
      they are also great for acting as large navigation links elsewhere in the
      application.

      ## Tile types


      There are two types of **Tile** available for use:\ 


      | Type | Description |

      | --- | --- |

      | Default  |  Used for data visualisation and assembling a dashboard
      - the default type has an icon and text that can be used for desktop and
      other larger devices |

      | Title Tile  | These are similar to the standard Tile, but they
      don't have an icon and require less space - perfect for users that are
      using a device with a smaller amount of space  |

      ## Using a Tile


      ### Tile labels


      All **Tiles** should have a label, **just like Buttons**. Make sure
      you use an informative label that describes where it will take the user,
      and be mindful of keeping it concise. You can check out the
      [Structure](guidelines/style-guide/#structure) section of the Style Guide
      for more help on creating appropriate headings and labels.


      Labels in the **Tile** should also be centrally aligned.


      ### Tile icons


      Similarly, the icon in a **Tile** should be centrally aligned.\ 


      The icons are set to a height and width of 48px, and should use the
      icons from the [Icons8 icon
      library](https://mosaic-icon-search.oneadvanced.io/).


      ### Number of Tiles


      We do not have rules governing the number of **Tiles** that you
      include on a page. However, do keep in mind that an overuse of **Tiles**
      will make it hard for users to locate the content they are looking for.
      For example, 16 or more **Tiles** would be harder to navigate than an
      application that uses an effective navigation system, such as a
      [**Navigation bar**](/components/navigation-bar) component."
