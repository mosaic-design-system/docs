    body: "## What is a Collapse ?


      A collapse allows you to show and hide content, with a button acting
      as the toggle for the visibility of the content.

      - - -


      ### When, and why?


      A collapse button should be used when you want to show the user a
      collapsed view, but additional content is available on the click of the
      button.\ 


      This may be where there is lots of content already displayed on a
      page such as multiple users contact details. The collapse button could be
      used to show more information about one of the users without taking the
      user to another page.\r


      - - -



      ### Using a collapse

      A collapse must always have a toggle button and some collapsible
      content, e.g. a paragraph of text.


      \r

      The contents of a collapse should never include critical information
      such as important instructions, warnings, etc.\r


      If you intend to show/hide multiple pieces of related information on
      a page, then an Accordion is the preferred method.\r
