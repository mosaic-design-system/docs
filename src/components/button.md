      ## What is a Button?


      A **Button** should be used when a user is given a possible action â€“ these are usually things like submissions, confirmations, cancellations, et cetera. They can serve many purposes, and are mostly used to initialise a certain process within the system.

      ### When, and why?


      **Buttons** should be used when a **Call to Action (CTA)** is needed on a page, **Form** or **Card**. Users will recognise that a **Button** must be pressed in order to carry out a specific task.

      ## Types of Buttons


      In Mosaic, there are six types of **Buttons**. Each **Button Type** has a different function, and the look of the button will signal a different usage to the user. For example, a **Primary Button** tends to be the most positive outcome for an action, things like submitting a form or saving a sheet. Conversely, a **Danger Button** tends to be something negative, like deleting something. 


      | Button Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Example                                                                                                     |

      | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | **Primary**   | Used for the main CTA on the screen. This is reserved for actions such as add, import or save. There should only ever be one **Primary Button** on the page, **Form** or **Card**                                                                                                                                                            | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Primary</span> </button>    |

      | **Secondary** | Buttons that do not fall into one of the other categories. This can be used for things that are largely inconsequential but necessary, like closing a dialogue box.                                                                                                                                                                          | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--secondary"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Secondary</span></button> |

      | **Success**   | used for positive actions, like saving, confirming accepting or editing. Typically, like the **Primary Button**, there should only be one **Success Button**.                                                                                                                                                                                | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--success"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Success</span> </button>    |

      | **Warning**   | Not used very often, but they can be useful when you want the user to take caution with a particular action. You might want to include a **Button** to reload some data, for example, but want to warn the user not to do this too often.                                                                                                    | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--warning"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Warning</span> </button>    |

      | **Danger**    | Should be used for dangerous or destructive activity, like deleting or removing something from the system. Typically this should be the only **Danger Button** available to the user at that time.                                                                                                                                           | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--danger"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Danger</span> </button>      |

      | **Info**      | Can be used when the user might require some more context, or for less important actions than the **Primary Button**. Some examples would be an **Info Button** that opens a new dialogue box with some additional information, or perform an action that does not leave the page or make any change to data, i.e. print or view guidelines. | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--info"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Info</span> </button>          |

      ## Button Variants


      In addition to the **Button Type**, each **Button** can also have a **Button Variant**. A **Variant** can be applied to a **Button** to give it some more context, or add some additional functionality to the **Button**.


      | Variant           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

      | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | **Disabled**      | This can be added to limit when a **Button** can be used. A **Disabled Button** is always visible to the user, but it will not be interactable until the user has completed a specific task. Once the task in question has been performed, the **Disabled Button** will be set to active.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary" disabled> <span class="mcc-button__label">Disabled</span> </button>                                                                                                                                                                                             |

      | **Icon**          | **Buttons** can (and should) be given an icon to provide further context. Read below in the **[Button Icons](https://mosaic-design-system.herokuapp.com/components/button/#button-icons)** section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary"><mcc-icon name="does-not-exist" aria-hidden="true"></mcc-icon><span class="mcc-button__label">Icon</span></button>                                                                                                                                              |

      | **Trailing Icon** | You can also use **Trailing Icons** in a **Button**, which appear after the text rather than before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary"><mcc-icon name="does-not-exist" aria-hidden="true"></mcc-icon><span class="mcc-button__label">Icon</span><mcc-icon name="arrows_long_right" aria-hidden="true"></mcc-icon></button>                                                                             |

      | **Spinner**       | **Buttons** that provide tactile feedback to the user that something is happening when they interact with it. This can be useful for situations where a **Button's** function is not immediately carried out, e.g. when the system needs a few moments to save the changes the user has made. This type of animation on the **Button** can have a positive impression on the user, letting them know that the system has not just timed out or is unresponsive.                                                                                                             | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary"><svg class="mcc-spinner" viewBox="0 0 50 50"><circle class="mcc-spinner__track" cx="25" cy="25" r="20" fill="none" stroke-width="5"></circle><circle cx="25" cy="25" r="20" fill="none" stroke-width="5"></circle></svg><span class="mcc-button__label"></span> |

      | **Outline**       | **Outline Buttons** are not full-colour buttons â€“ instead, they are just a **Button** outline. This is useful when the **Button** is on a page that has a coloured background.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--outline"><mcc-icon name="does-not-exist" aria-hidden="true"></mcc-icon><span class="mcc-button__label">Outline</span> </button>                                                                                                                                          |

      | **Anchor**        | **Buttons** that are styled to look like an anchor (which in turn looks like a link). This is useful for adding emphasis to a link, and you want to encourage the user to interact with it as they would any other action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--anchor"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Link</span> </button>                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

      | **Block**         | **Buttons** that are larger than others, and span to fit their container. Normally this is used when you have a single action on a page that you need to draw attention to, like a login page or a button to register for something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary mcc-button--block"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Block</span> </button>                                                                                                                                                                                       |

      | **Small**         | **Small Buttons** are the opposite â€“ necessary **Buttons** that are small and unobtrusive. These can be used in situations where you have limited space, or for situations like a table with repeated actions all across it (such as editing and deleting).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary mcc-button--sm"> <span class="mcc-button__label">Small</span> </button>                                                                                                                                                                                          |

      | **Icon-Only**     | **Icon Only Buttons** are **Buttons** without a label but containing an icon. These should use universally known icons and actions for common functionality, such as a save, delete or home icon. These are rare and should only be used in specific cases. There is a separate document for **Icon Only Buttons** which you can be found on the **Icon Only Buttons** documentation page, and you should read the [entry for **Button Labels**](https://mosaic-design-system.herokuapp.com/components/button/#button-labels) for the limitations on using this **Button**. | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--primary mcc-button--icon-only"><mcc-icon name="does-not-exist" aria-hidden="true"></mcc-icon><span class="mcc-button__label">Primary</span> </button>                                                                                                                    |

      | **Soft**          | **Soft Buttons** are medium-emphasis **Buttons**. They contains actions that are important, but aren't the primary action in an app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <button class="mcc-button mcc-button--soft-primary"><mcc-icon name="does-not-exist" aria-hidden="true"></mcc-icon><span class="mcc-button__label">Outline</span> </button>                                                                                                                                     |


      > \*if a user will never be able to use the **Button**, for example if they lack the requisite permissions or security, then a **Button** should just not be visible to them. It is frustrating for a user to see a **Button** and never have the ability to use it. It should also be clear to the user what they need to do to enable this Button.

      ## Using a Button


      There are many ways to implement **Buttons** in a product, and there are many views to support each of those solutions. After carrying out extensive research, the UX Team have agreed on what we believe to be the best rules governing the usage of **Buttons** across Advanced products. Use these following guidelines when implementing a **Button** into your product.


      ### Ordering of Buttons


      We have a set order for groups of **Buttons** in our products, to encourage user familiarity and build a familiarity around what a user can expect, and where. The ordering is simple: the least positive **Button** is the one furthest to the left, and the most positive **Button** is the one to the right. As an example, a form with 'Delete', 'Cancel' and 'Save' would be ordered as such â€“ 'Delete' is the most negative, 'Save' is the most positive, and 'Cancel' is relatively neutral. 


      This ordering of the **Buttons** provides a sense of 'moving forward' to the used when they see a **Button** on the right-hand side, whereas a **Button** on the left-hand side feels like 'moving backward'. 


      ### Button Labels


      A B**utton's Label** is as important as the **Button** itself. A set of **Buttons** that are simply a green and a red **Button** might imply 'good' and 'bad' actions, but there is no context for the user. As such, there are a couple of things to keep in mind when labelling a **Button**:


      â€¢	**Buttons** require a **Label** in the vast majority of cases. We cannot assume that a user will instinctively know what an icon means on a **Button**. An infamous example of this is the classic floppy disk icon for saving â€“ think about how soon it will be until virtually all of our users will have never seen a floppy disk? 


      \>**Note**: there are some very specific use cases for Icon-only Buttons, but these are few and far between. We have [guidance](link) on where a **Button** can forgo a label, but the UX Team should be contacted in advance of using an **Icon Only Button** to ensure that it is appropriate. 


      â€¢	**Button Labels** should be specific, rather than general. A user should feel confident that they know what a **Button** does. Generic **Buttons** like 'OK' when a user is actually changing something are not informative enough â€“ the user needs to know that the **Button** will 'Confirm changes', which is a much better **Label**.


      If you are unsure about **Labels**, please review the [product tone-of-voice document](link) or contact the UX Copywriter.


      ### Button Icons


      **Icons** can be used to give further meaning to your **Buttons**. By default, all **Buttons** should have an **Icon**, but occasionally this is not always practical when there is not an obvious **Icon** available for use, or there are space limitations for the **Button**. In cases like these, it is acceptable to forgo an icon.


      When using an **Icon**, the **Icon** should always appear to the left of the **Button's Label**. The **Icon** is describing the **Label**, not the other way around! It also improves readability and is easier to quickly scan the functionality of each **Button** if the **Icons** all appear on the left-hand side.


      ### Button Colours


      The colour of your **Button** will be dictated by the **Button Type**. For example, a **Primary Button** is green, whereas a **Danger Button** is red. The rationale is simple: green is associated with positive actions (green for go), while red is associated with negative actions (red for stop). However, it should be noted that colour only gives a visual clue if that visual cue is perceptible to the user â€“ screen readers and colour-blind users will get no benefit from **Button Colours**. This is why it is important to use a combination of **Button Labels** and **Icons** to properly delineate the usage of a **Button**.


      Refer to the **[Button Types section]**(https://mosaic-design-system.herokuapp.com/components/button/#types-of-buttons) to read about the different colours for **Button Types**.


      ### Consistency


      Consistency among your **Buttons** is vital for users. A user needs to feel comfortable, confident and at-home when using our products. **Button** consistency is a really easy way of achieving it â€“ if a user can tell with a quick glance what the **Buttons** do in a new feature, based on their previous experience with the product, then they will adopt it much quicker, and user errors will be minimised. Inconsistent **Buttons** quickly lead to poor adoption of products and rampant confusion. 


      A few ways you can achieve consistency is making sure your **Labels** are identical in all areas â€“ do not switch between using 'close' and 'cancel' on your **Buttons**. Pick one, and stick with it. The same goes for **Icons**. Make sure you review your **Buttons** in comparison to others in the system when making them.

      ## Component accessibility 


      This component has been built to meet the current WCAG AA 2.1 guidelines. We also test these components against the guidelines before release. 


      ## Colour combinations 


      Please be mindful of colour contrast when using these buttons. Please make sure that the there is a clear colour contrast between the button and the background it is on. Please check this using this colour checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). 


      ## Key binding 


      You should be able to select, submit data, confirm etc from all buttons via the keyboard â€˜enterâ€™ key. 


      ## Aria tags 


      Please ensure that all buttons have aria tags to ensure screen readers can understand that they are focussed on a button. 


      ## Focus state 


      All buttons should have a focus state and be able to have a focus applied to them by tabbing via a keyboard. (See focus state styling). 


      ## Wording  


      Please ensure that wording is as descriptive of the action as possible to help people understand clearly what action they are performing when they select the button. 


      ## Icons  


      Buttons without text should only be used as a last resort to save space on a table etc.
