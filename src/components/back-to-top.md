    body: "## What is a back to top button?


      The back to top button is a button positioned on the bottom
      right-hand corner of the page. It fades in when the user has scrolled
      beyond a specific point on the website and needs to easily navigate back
      to the top of the page.

      ### When, and why?


      The Back to Top component allows users to smoothly scroll back to
      the top of the page. It enhances the navigation of the user on pages with
      lots of content and easily need to get back to the top.

      ### Usage


      The back to top should only be used for pages with lots of content
      and lots of content, i.e., do not use on short pages.\ 


      It can be placed anywhere in the body of your page and allows you to
      have a convenient button fade in the bottom right-hand corner of the
      screen, that quickly scrolls the user back to the top of the page.\r

      \r

      The number of pixels the user scrolls before the button appears can
      be specified using the scroll-y attribute.\r
