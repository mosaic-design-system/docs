      ## What is a back to top?


      The Back to Top component is a button positioned in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. It fades in when the user has scrolled beyond a specific point on the website and needs to easily navigate back to the top of the page.

      ### When, and why?


      The Back to Top component allows users to scroll smoothly back to the top of the page. It enhances the navigation of the user on pages with lots of content and easily need to get back to the top.

      ### Using a back to top


      The back to top should only be used for pages with lots of content and lots of content, i.e., do not use on short pages. 


      It can be placed anywhere in the body of your page and allows you to have a convenient button fade in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, that quickly scrolls the user back to the top of the page.


      The number of pixels the user scrolls before the button appears can be specified using the scroll-y attribute.

## What are components?

Components are the backbone of the Mosaic design system and will be used in your application's UI to create a consistent look and feel across different areas of functionality. In this section of the **Mosaic Design System**, you will find a page for each of the components that has four separate tabs that will guide you through using them.

## Usage

The **Usage** tab of each component will spell out the golden rules for each component. On this tab you'll be able to find out:

- what exactly the component *is*, and where it should be used
- the different types of that component (types are variations or modifiers that can be put onto a component to customise it to your needs)
- guidance on *how* to use the component, with clear instructions around special considerations that need to be made when including it in your software


## Code

The **Code** tab contains a link to the Storybook page for that component. On Storybook, you'll be able to read the documentation for the actual code of each component, and get a comprehensive list of things you can do to that component to alter it to suit your needs.

You will also be able to find a working demo of the component so you can see it in action. 

## Accessibility

Each component also has a tab that covers the specific accessibility considerations you need to make when using it. This covers things like colour combinations for colour blind users, keyboard shortcuts, and the usage of icons. Make sure to read this tab to make your software as accessible as possible for all of your users.

## Component status

The **Status** tab will show you the current status of the component - you will be able to see a breakdown of whether the component has been designed, documented, has available HTML/CSS documentation and whether it has a web component (a web component will include additional JavaScript for expanded functionality).
