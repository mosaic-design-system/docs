    body: "## What are Tabs?


      **Tabs** allow a significant amount of content to be viewed without
      having to navigate away from that page and reduce scrolling required. The
      content is instead broken up into multiple sections with each section
      having its own tab available with just one click.

      ## When, and why?


      **Tabs** are an easy way to organize content and switch between
      related content.  **Tabs** consist of two or more **tabs** which behave in
      a similar manner to a link, the user remains on the original page, but
      different content is displayed. Tabs can be shown horizontally or
      vertically to adapt and suit the content being shown and the devices being
      used to view it.

      ## Types of Tabs

      Horizontal tabs \r

      Horizontal tabs provide more vertical space and enable easy scanning
      of items, this helps with reading from left to right. Horizontal **tabs**
      also allow you to occupy the content area of your page with content
      only.\r


      Vertical tabs\r

      Vertical tabs work best for form or installation wizards when a user
      is working down a list of steps and horizontal **tabs** are best for
      groups of related information.\r

      ## Using Tabs


      •\tTabs should be arranged in a logical order for example the first
      tab is the most important or more most read

      \r

      •\tSingle tabs should never be used


      \r

      •\tTabs should not be used as an alternative form of navigation
      replacing links or breadcrumbs to take the user to another page or part of
      the application


      \r

      •\tThe size of the tabs should not be modified, they are large
      enough for users to easily click or tap them. Mobile tabs need to be at
      least the size of a finger of at least 30px wide.


      \r

      •\tContent should be placed in the correct tab. Avoid mismatching
      content that doesn’t fit in a tab


      \r

      •\tTab headers should be clear and concise but still give the user
      enough information about what each tab contains. In doing so speed and
      ease of use can be improved.

      \r

      •\tTab headings should be sentence case with only the first letter
      of the first word in capitals rather than the first letter of every word
      capitalised.

      \r

      Accessibility Tip: The active tab should have the attribute
      aria-selected set to true, and the others to false. The active panel
      associated with the active tab should have the attribute aria-hidden set
      to true, and the others to false. In addition, each tab should have an
      aria-controls attribute set to the id of the matching panel and each panel
      should have an aria-labelledby attribute set to the id of the tab
      associated with the panel.\r\n"
