## What are components?

Components are the back bone of the design system and used in your applications UI to create a consistent look and feel across your different areas of functionality. They often have extensions and variations to achieve specific meaning, so make sure to check out the API of each component to see what is available.  

## Component status

Underneath the title of each component page you will see its current status (an example "HTML/CSS: Available" can be seen underneath this page title). This denotes whether the component is available in product, under review or proposed. A full list of components can be found below.
