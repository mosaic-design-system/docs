    body: "## What is a Treeview?


      A **treeview** presents a hierarchical view of information by
      breaking them down into multiple levels of importance. The tree view
      allows for required levels to be opened whilst the rest of the tree can
      remain collapsed reducing the amount of space required but maintaining the
      necessary information.

      ## When, and why?


      A **treeview** can be used for large sets of data which can be
      categorised into two or more levels. This provides a natural hierarchy and
      structure. This should be familiar to most users even with two or more
      levels

      ## Using a Treeview


      The tree view can be for content which has a hierarchical structure,
      the tree view displays a parent and child relationship where you would
      like to show and hide information where the contents can be arranged in
      levels of importance.\r

      An accordion or collapse might be more appropriate if you have large
      amounts of sections that you want to hide and show at once where there
      isn’t hierarchy and structure.

      \r

      •\t**Treeview** shouldn’t be used as an alternative form of
      navigation

      \r

      •\tIt should be used for content that has a hierarchy.


      \r

      •\tThe **treeview** be expanded to reveal the sub-items and
      collapsed to hide items.

      \r

      •\tA **treeview** should not have more than four sub-levels with the
      most accessed or important items appearing in the first two levels.

      \r

      •\tEach level should have indentation to differentiate them.\r\n"
