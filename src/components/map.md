      ## What is a Map?


      A **Map** is a interactable digital representation of a physical map, i.e. a diagram of an area of land or sea showing physical features, cities and roads with controls for search and zoom.

      ### When, and why?


      A **Map** can be used in places like contact pages or about sections of your application to increase awareness of a location and display key points.


      The **Map** can provide regional information that will help the user locate a particular service and calculate the distance between two markers.

      ### Using a map


      ### Map markers

      Whenever a **Map** is used to show a location, a marker should be displayed on the location to illustrate effectively where the user's attention should be focused.


      ### Map zoom

      A **Map** should have functionality that allows the user to zoom in and out to get a wider context of the location. There should also be a zoom level included to show how zoomed in the user is.


      ### Map cursor

      While the user's cursor is over the map, it should change to a 'hand' symbol rather than a pointer to demonstrate that the map is interactable.
