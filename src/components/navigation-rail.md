      ## What is a Navigation Rail?


      A Navigation Rail is a side navigation component that displays links to primary destinations in an application.

      ### When, and why?


      Navigation Rails provide a compact, but consistent approach to navigation. They should be used to provide access to top-level destinations on desktops and tablets, which need to be accessed from anywhere. On smaller screens the rail should transition to a Navigation Bar \[link to Navigation Bar page]. Although a rail can be used in its own, when there is a secondary navigation structure, it should be used in conjunction with a Drawer component \[link to Drawer page] to display secondary destinations or actions.

      ## Navigation Rail types


      The following types of Navigation Rail are available:


      | **Name**      | **Description**                                                                         | **Behaviour** |

      | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |

      | Default       | A Navigation Rail containing up to 8 destinations, represented by icons and text labels |               |

      | With tooltips | Adds tooltips to each item of a rail                                                    |               |

      ## Using a Navigation Rail


      When users click or tap a rail item, they are taken to the top-level destination associated with it and that item appears selected. Navigation rail destinations are always represented by icons that indicate the content or the nature of a destination. In addition, they must always include text labels. Icons alone should never be used, as icons may not be universally known and will automatically exclude users that do not known what they mean. Text labels should provide short, meaningful descriptions and provide an alternative way for users to understand an iconâ€™s meaning. Labels should not be truncated and wrapping long labels should be avoided when possible.


      Navigation Rails can contain up to 8 items.


      Rail icons can include Chips \[link to Chips component page] to convey information about the associated destination, such as a count. When Chips are used in this way, they must be placed centrally, underneath a rail item.


      Navigation rails are placed on the left-hand side of the screen and always runs vertically along the side of a page.


      The top of a rail can also be used for a logo. However, this is dependent on the layout you are using. For example, if you are using a layout where the Navigation Header runs all the way across the top of the screen, then the logo would be placed on the left-hand side of the header. For more information, refer to Layouts \[link to Layouts page. We don't currently have one, but as we introduce more layouts, we'll need a page to document them].


      As mention above, rails can also be used with a Drawer component. This supports your navigation structure if you have secondary destinations or additional actions. However, a drawer is unnecessary if there are no secondary destinations or actions in your application.


      When moving from a large screen to a smaller display, rails transform into a Navigation Bar component, while still providing the same access but in a way that's suitable for smaller screens. However, the Navigation Rail and Navigation Bar should not be used together.
