      ## What is a Card


      *<a href="[http://example.com/"](http://example.com/%22 "http\://example.com/%22")Â target="_blank">Hello, world! <mcc-icon class="mcc-icon--primary" name="home" icon-set="" width="24" height="24"></mcc-icon></a>*


      Cards form the backbone of all content areas. They should surround and group your content into meaningful 'boxes' of functionality, and can be used alongside columns and rows to lay out your application in a variety of ways.


      Cards are used frequently throughout all of our reference applications and examples.

      ### When and why


      All over the place! Cards should surround all components in your content-container, either the whole page or subdivided into separate cards per functional area.  Within a card you can have other nested cards to help with grouping of components/information.

      ## Card types


      | **Variant**           | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                |

      | Grouping              | A grey Card to group components together to indicate their relationship to each other.                                                                                                         |

      | Selected active       | Active state of a selected card - when the card is clicked to be selected or the card is being dragged.                                                                                        |

      | Contextual            | Styled to indicate the context of the Card.  This should be used to represent the contents of the Card.  Eg a danger context Card could be used to show information about issues in the system |


      ## Card contexts


      Context helps convey the information being communicated. **Card** contexts correspond to a colour to provide a consistent experience for users. For more information, refer to the [Colours](/guidelines/colours) guidelines.


      | **Name** | **Description**                                                                                                               | **Examples**                                                                                          |

      | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | Success  | Indicates a Card with positive information or selected for a positive action. The Success colour is green.                    | To highlight target that have been met. The user selects a Card(s) to be added as part of an action.  |

      | Danger   | Indicates errors and, optionally, prevents users from proceeding until the issue has been resolved. The Danger colour is red. | The user inputs an invalid configuration for a record                                                 |

      | Warning  | Indicates that actions are not desirable or might have unexpected results. The Warning colour is yellow.                      | The user enters a record that will overwrite another non-critical record                              |

      ## Using a Card


      **Cards** are used to display all content with the application.  On a page you could have just one card, or hundreds of cards, depending on what you are needing to do.  Cards can be laid out in grids, but the grids should be responsive so that cards tend to stay a similar size and more vertical space is used on smaller screens by decreasing the number of columns. 


      ### Nested cards


      Cards can be nested within another Card to aid the users understanding of what is grouped together.  As with any card these can be organised in columns an rows to best suit the data being displayed, however in forms they should always be in only a single column.  Nested cards are when you might want to use the Grouping type to help separate it from the parent card. 


      ### Headers


      A Card may have a header section which could contain a title, subtitle and other inputs (eg Buttons or Selects) for additional actions related to the card.  The header section should always be used for items that relate to the whole card


      ### Footers


      The footer section of a Card is there for actions on the card in the form of buttons.  This is where the call to action button would live for example.  On forms this can also be used to show additional information to the user, eg All fields are required.
