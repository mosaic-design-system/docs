      A quick way for the user to return to the top of your content.

      ### When, and why?


      The Back to Top component allows users to smoothly scroll back to
      the top of the page. It's a little detail that enhances the navigation
      experience on applications with long pages. The button fades in after the
      browser window has been scrolled beyond a specified point.

      ### Rules


      Only suitable for pages with lots of content, i.e., do not use on
      short pages.

      ### Using the back to top button


      \r

      The Back to Top component can be placed anywhere in the body of your
      page and allows you to have a convenient button fade in the bottom
      right-hand corner of the screen, that quickly scrolls the user back to the
      top of the page.\r

      \r

      The number of pixels the user scrolls before the button appears can
      be specified using the scroll-y attribute.\r
