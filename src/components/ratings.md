      ## What is a Rating?


      **Ratings** provide a way for users to evaluate or assess content. User-submitted **Ratings** can help users evaluate whether or not something is fit for purpose.

      ### When, and why?


      A **Ratings** system is useful when you need users to engage with your product to express their emotion towards a particular item, or make more complex decisions by using other users' feedback. **Ratings** are an invaluable source of feedback that can help surface issues with products and inform innovation.

      ## Rating types


      The following **Rating** types are available:


      | **Variant** | **Description**                                                               |

      | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | **Star**    | The stars give a 1-5 scale rating                                             |

      | **Thumbs**  | The thumbs up and down rating collects a binary positive or negative response |

      | **Heart**   | Using the heart allows you collect and count only positive responses          |

      | **Faces**   | This scale collects a satisfaction or emotion rating                          |

      ## Using Ratings


      ### Rating Types


      The star (1-5 scale) type works well when you want feedback on a new feature or if the rating is to be shared with other users e.g. '145 rated ‘X’ 4/5. 


      The Faces (satisfaction scale) are directly liked the user emotion and would be best suited when you are asking the user about their overall experience on a product or workflow.


      Thumbs (like or dislike) and hearts should be seen as reactional feedback and given in direct response to something intending to give instant results. For example, a blog post, a help document, a diagram, or image. This type of feedback can be used to promote content or help get high-level insights


      Once you have chosen a **Rating** type, you should stick to that type throughout your product. Comparing data from different source types can be difficult, and mixing different sources of data collection can lead to poor quality data.


      ### Rating frequency


      **Ratings** are an excellent source of quantifiable feedback, but user uptake can generally be harmed by bombarding the user with constant requests for feedback. If you make use of the **Ratings** component, take care not to use it too frequently. Remember that there are other sources of user feedback, such as /\[User Research](link to user research guideline).


      **Ratings** can be used in multiple ways to either collect or present different types of data. There are no hard set rules on using the **Ratings** components, except that you should keep it consistent throughout your product and do not bombard the user with too many on the screen at one given time.
