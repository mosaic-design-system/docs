      ## What is an Alert?


      An **Alert** is something you show to your users to send them a message. This can include important feedback on what they're doing within the product, and help them understanding exactly what their actions will affect across the entire system, page or form. **Alerts** can be contextual too, indicating a positive or negative message, a warning, or just a piece of important information.

      ### When, and why?


      **Alerts** can be used to draw a user's attention to information you want them to know, such as status changes or updates. An **Alert** should contain information that is important to the user and should always be relevant. They can be generated in response to user actions (for example while they are performing a task within the software), or automatically generated by your application (such as notifying the user when a process that was running in the background has been completed). The main difference between these two methods is one provides immediate feedback, while the other provides updates on system activities.


      **Alerts** can require an action, or simply contain information. When it requires an action, **Alerts** should actively interrupt the user's journey. However, **Alerts** that do not need an action can be less intrusive and subtler.


      **Note:** **Alerts** must not be confused with or used as form validation. Form validation is tied to individual form fields and use an input's help text.

      ## Alert types


      The following types of **Alerts** are available:


      | **Name**    | **Description**                                                                            | **Behaviour**                             | 

      | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | 

      | **Default**     | An Alert that contains an icon, a title, and a line of text                                | Persists. Cannot be dismissed or actioned |

      | **Compact**     | An Alert that contains an icon and a title                                                 | Persists. Cannot be dismissed or actioned |

      | **Coloured**    | An Alert that contains an icon, a title, and a line of text, with a coloured background    | Persists. Cannot be dismissed or actioned |

      | **Solid**       | An Alert that contains an icon, a title, and a line of text, with a solid white background | Persists. Cannot be dismissed or actioned |

      | **Dismissible** | An Alert that can be dismissed                                                             | Persists, but can be dismissed            |

      | **Actionable**  | An Alert that contains an action                                                           | Persists, but can be actioned             |

      ## Alert contexts


      Context helps convey the information being communicated. **Alert** contexts correspond to a colour and an icon to provide a consistent experience for users. For more information, please refer to [Colours](guidelines/colour/).


      | **Name** | **Description**                                                                                                              | **Behaviour**                                                                     | **Examples**                                          |

      | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

      | **Success**  | Indicates actions were completed successfully. The Success colour is green.                                                   | Does not require user interaction, as disappears automatically after a short time | A new record saved or preferences have been updated   |

      | **Danger**   | Indicates errors and, optionally, prevents users from proceeding until the issue has been resolved. The Danger colour is red. | Always persists until the user dismisses or resolves the issue                    | Credentials cannot be found or access is denied       |

      | **Warning**  | Indicates that actions are not desirable or might have unexpected results. The Warning colour is yellow.                      | Persists until the user dismisses or continues regardless                         | A file is too big or a file already exists            |

      | **Info**     | Indicates neutral or advisory information that may not be related to the current action. The info colour is teal.             | Does not require user interaction, but persists until user dismisses              | Scheduled system maintenance or a new report is ready |

      ## Using an Alert


      ### Alert actions


      Actions are a good idea for an **Alert** if they are telling the user to do something. Even if the action on the **Alert** isn't what they need to do, a link to place they need to go to achieve that action is a great idea.


      If you do include an action, then there should only ever be one. If you require two actions on an **Alert**, the user should instead be signposted to where they can complete the requested task.


      ### Alert dismissal


      **Alerts** should only ever use a dismissible type when they are **non-critical** messages. A user is not guaranteed to be looking at the screen when the **Alert** is generated, and a user's disability may prevent them from reading or interacting with the **Alert** quick enough to action the warning.


      ### Alert frequency

      Although **Alerts** are great for communicating, we recommend that they are used sparingly. If users are continually being interrupted by **Alerts**, then this can become frustrating and impact their productivity. 


      Overusing **Alerts** may quickly see their importance fade and users may decide to ignore them, which would defeat the point! **Alerts** should be an exception to the user's normal workflow, to ensure their attention is captured.



      ### Alert length

      **Alerts** should always communicate a single, succinct message, which provide clear instructions and optionally offer actions a user can take. Ideally, they should take up no more than two lines.


      ### Alert placement


      **Alerts** should never stack vertically, nor should more than one **Alert** be visible at once. Each **Alert** type has its own distinct region in which it should be displayed. For consistency, these locations should not be ignored. The locations can be found in the [System Messaging](guidelines/system-messaging) guidelines.


      **Alerts** should never cover another piece of content on the page - covering up a piece of content with an **Alert** may prove disruptive to users and inhibit their usage of the product.
