      ## What is a Navigation Bar?


      A **Navigation bar** is a bottom navigation component that displays links to primary destinations in an application.

      ### When, and why?


      **Navigation bars** provide a compact, but consistent approach to navigation. They should be used to provide access to top-level destinations on mobile devices, which need to be accessed from anywhere. On larger screens, the bar should transition to a [**Navigation rail**](/components/navigation-rail). Although a **Bar** can be used in its own, when there is a secondary navigation structure, it should be used in conjunction with a [**Drawer**}(/components/drawer) to display secondary destinations or actions.

      ## Using a Navigation Bar


      ### Navigation items


      Each item on a **Bar** takes the user to the top-level destination associated with it, and that item then appears selected. **Navigation** bar destinations are always represented by icons and labels that indicate the content or the nature of a destination (see below for more information on using labels and icons effectively). 


      **Navigation bars** can contain up to 5 items. If there are more items, then the fifth item should become a "More" button, which displays a separate menu of the additional items.


      ### Bar positioning


      **Navigation bars** must be fixed to the bottom of the screen, i.e. when the page content is scrolled, the **Bar** remains visible. They run horizontally across the bottom of the screen, but do not scroll or move horizontally.


      ### Icons


      Icons alone should never be used, as icons may not be universally known and will automatically exclude users that do not known what they mean.


      Bar icons can include [**Chips**](/components/chips) to convey information about the associated destination, such as a count. When **Chips** are used in this way, they must be placed centrally, underneath a bar item.


      ### Labels


      In addition, they must always include text labels. Text labels should provide short, meaningful descriptions and provide an alternative way for users to understand an iconâ€™s meaning. Labels should not be truncated and wrapping long labels should be avoided when possible.


      ### Drawer

      As mentioned above, **Bars** can also be used with a **Drawer** component. This supports your navigation structure if you have secondary destinations or additional actions. However, a **Drawer** is unnecessary if there are no secondary destinations or actions in your application.


      ### Bars on other devices

      When moving from a small screen to a larger display, **Bars** transform into a **Navigation rail** component. The **Rail** provides the same access as a **Bar**, but in a way that's suitable for larger screens. **Rails** and **Bars** should never appear on the same page together.
