      ## What is a Snackbar?


      A **Snackbar** is a short message that appears at the bottom centre of the user's screen. They are a great way of showing updates about the progress of an operation without being intrusive.

      ### When, and why?


      **Snackbars** inform users of something that has been, or will be, performed by the system. They are a small message that appears at the bottom of the page that lets the user know that something has or hasn't been completed, or provides further context to an action.


      For example, if a user has requested a report that takes some time to generate, and then moves to another area of the product, a **Snackbar** would appear at the bottom of the screen to notify them when the report has finished generating.

      ## Snackbar types


      In addition to the contextual type, each **Snackbar** also has an option between 2 variants: 


      | Variant      | Description                                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                          |

      | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | **Default**  | This will cover use cases where the a simple message covers the update and no further action is required. | |

      | **With CTA** | Cases where you may want to give the user an opportunity to take another single action, you would use the **Snackbar with a CTA**. | |

      ## Snackbar contexts


      ## Alert contexts


      Context helps convey the information being communicated. **Snackbar** contexts correspond to a colour and an icon to provide a consistent experience for users. For more information, please refer to [Colours](guidelines/colour/).


      | **Name** | **Description**                                                                                                              | **Behaviour**                                                                     | **Examples**                                          |

      | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

      | **Success**  | Indicates actions were completed successfully. The Success colour is green.                                                   | Does not require user interaction, as disappears automatically after a short time | A new record saved or preferences have been updated   |

      | **Danger**   | Indicates errors and, optionally, prevents users from proceeding until the issue has been resolved. The Danger colour is red. | Always persists until the user dismisses or resolves the issue                    | Credentials cannot be found or access is denied       |

      | **Warning**  | Indicates that actions are not desirable or might have unexpected results. The Warning colour is yellow.                      | Persists until the user dismisses or continues regardless                         | A file is too big or a file already exists            |

      | **Info**     | Indicates neutral or advisory information that may not be related to the current action. The info colour is teal.             | Does not require user interaction, but persists until user dismisses              | Scheduled system maintenance or a new report is ready |

      ## Using a Snackbar


      ### Auto-dismiss

      **Snackbars** donâ€™t interrupt the user experience, and should disappear automatically after maximum of ten seconds without user interaction. Interrupting the user's workflow by forcing them to interact with a **Snackbar** will add unnecessary complications - a **Snackbar** should be a quick "we thought you should know this!" message, and do not need to be acknowledged by the user.


      ### Snackbars with CTA's

      A **Snackbar** can contain an optional single action, such as "Undo", "Retry" or "Reload". Selecting the action performs the action and closes the **Snackbar**. 


      If your **Snackbar** contains multiple CTA's, then you may be providing too much for the user to read in the ten second timeframe - you could instead use the **Snackbar** to notify the user that something requires their attention, and the CTA takes them to a different page with more options.


      ### Snackbar placement

      **Snackbars** must be displayed one at a time. Multiple **Snackbars** at once will overwhelm a user. They must be placed at the bottom centre of a screen, in front of any page content, but they should avoid covering up any navigational components. Similarly, **Snackbars** shouldn't stack on top of one another. 


      ### Snackbar length

      **Snackbars** should only contain one or two lines of text. We must consider the amount of attention and time it takes for a user to absorb the message.


      In addition to using text to convey meaning, you can make use of the different colours and icons available on a **Snackbar** - an ideal scenario would have a user being able to tell at a glance if something was a failure or a success. 


      ### Snackbars are not progress indicators

      A **Snackbar** is never used as a loading or progress indicator. They are messages about finite results (i.e. completion or incompletion), and shouldn't be used as reminders that something is ongoing.
