# Storybook

**Link to storybook.**

The core components are a set of HTML and custom elements that are deployed to the Advanced CDN. Documentation for these can be viewed on Storybook, our component hosting and demonstration site of choice and an excellent open source tool for UI components and design systems.

For information on how to import components into your project, check the Getting Started page on Storybook, [here](https://refactored-telegram-b90726d9.pages.github.io/dev/components/?path=/docs/getting-started-introduction--page).

The documentation for each individual component is listed in the side menu:

![Storybook side menu](/assets/img/capture.png "Storybook side menu")

You can select from two options in the toolbar of each component. The **Canvas** shows a preview of the component you've selected, whilst **Docs** lists the variants and their associated code.

![Canvas and docs ](/assets/img/capture2.png "Canvas and docs")

In both instances. You can choose to flick between Light and Dark mode, as well as view various screen sizes and colour blindness overlays.

If you are looking for a particular component, you can use the Search/Filter available at the top of the menu:
