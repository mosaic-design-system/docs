## Checkbox choice button types

Checkboxes can be unselected, selected or indeterminate which is when a checkbox is neither selected or unselected and therefore cannot be determined. Active, Disabled, Read-only and Focussed states also apply to all of the above.

## Using a Checkbox choice button

Using a checkbox choice button is best suited when you have a smaller number of multiple choice items which require more than 1-5 words but can use a header and strapline to concisely articulate the meaning.

A Checkbox choice button should be used when there is a relevant subject matter image for each multiple choice option. And only when the image supports the user decision. Avoid mixing Checkbox choice buttons with and without an image, doing so will ensure the checkbox is always in the same position for each item Checkboxes are used for multiple choices, and work independently from other checkboxes in the same list therefore checking an additional box does not affect any other selections.
