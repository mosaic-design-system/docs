## What is a Collapse?

A **multi select** allows multiple items to be selected using a component. It is based on the form input dropdown component. The **multi select** differs however in that after an item has been selected the selected item displays as a chip like item in the top row of the dropdown whilst still maintaining the same behaviour to allow additional items to be selected.

## When, and why?

A ** multi select** behaves in a similar nature to a standard dropdown, however having the option to select multiple items allows it to be used where multiple categories can be selected or any other situation that would require the selection of more than one value.

## Using a collapse

•	Should only be used if it is required for two or more values to be selected

•	Labels should describe what is in the list and inform users what to expect.

•	Keep the labels short and concise, limiting it to a single line of text but if necessary two lines and an ellipsis.

•	Display your options in alphabetical order.

•	All headings should be sentence case and not have the first letter of every word capitalised.
