      ## What is a Radio button?


      A **Radio button** is a visual component that indicates if something is selected or not. A radio button differs from a checkbox in that only one radio button item can be selected from a list at any time.

      ### When, and why?


      A **Radio button** can be used in forms where it is only possible to select one item.

      ## Radio button types


      **Radio buttons** can be unselected or selected. Active, Disabled, Read-only and Focussed states also apply to both of the above.


      | **Name**                   | **Description** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

      | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | With label                 | This is the default and should be used to multiple choice lists and parent-child multiple choice lists                                                                                                                                        |

      | Without label              | This should only be used within a selector column of a table where the column header becomes the label for the radio button                                                                                                                   |

      | Radio choice button        | This is a container and the **Radio button** is within the container. This is used where a label isnâ€™t enough information and more text is required. This instead has both a title and subtitle accompanying the **Radio button** .           |

      | Radio choice button visual | It is similar to the radio choice button however there is an icon positioned to the left-hand side and the radio button itself is aligned to the right hand side.  This should only be used where the icon helps the user to make a selection |

      ## Using a Radio button


      **Radio buttons** are where multiple options are available however they are linked. Only one radio button can be selected from a list at any one time so if one in the list is selected the others will remain unselect or automatically become unselected.


      We only suggest using a **Radio button** as part of a form to collect data otherwise for example instances such as changing the view or other visual changes should use the segmented button component.


      ### Multiple-selects


      Do not use a **Radio button** if a user can select multiple options from a list. In this case, **[Checkboxes](/forms/checkbox/)** or a **Toggle switch** \[link to Toggle-switch page] depending on the 'save' should be used instead. **Radio buttons** only allow the user to select a single item from a set, whereas Checkboxes allow the user to select multiple options.
