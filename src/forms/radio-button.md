    body: "## What is a Radio button?


      A **Radio button** is a visual component that indicates if something
      is selected or not. A radio button differs from a checkbox in that only
      one radio button item can be selected from a list at any time.

      ### When, and why?


      A **Radio button** can be used in forms where it is only possible to
      select one item.

      ## Radio button types


      **Radio buttons** can be unselected or selected. Active, Disabled,
      Read-only and Focussed states also apply to both of the above.


      | **Name**      |
      **Description**                                                                                                           \
      |

      | ------------- |
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------\
      ------------------------------------------------ |

      | With label    | This is the default and should be used to multiple
      choice lists and parent-child multiple choice lists       |

      | Without label | This should only be used within a selector column
      of a table where the column header becomes the label for the radio button
      |

      | Radio choice button    | This is a container with the radio
      button. This is used where a label isnâ€™t enough information, and a title
      and subtitle are required. This is positioned within a container.       |

      | Visual Radio button    | It is similar to the radio choice button
      however there is an icon positioned to the left-hand side and the radio
      button itself is aligned to the right hand side.        |

      ## Using a Checkbox


      **Radio buttons** are where multiple options are available however
      they are linked. Only one radio button can be selected from a list at any
      one time so if one in the list is selected the others will remain unselect
      or automatically become unselected.

      \r

      We only suggest using a **Radio button** as part of a form to
      collect data otherwise for example instances such as changing the view or
      other visual changes should use the segmented button component.\r



      ### Multiple-selects


      Do not use a **Radio button** if a user can select only multiple
      options from a list. In this case, [Radio Buttons](link to Radio Buttons
      page) or a [Toggle switch](link to toggle-switch page) depending on the
      'save' should be used instead. Radio buttons only allow the user to select
      a single item from a set, whereas checkboxes allow the user to select only
      multiple options.\n"
