      ## What is a picklist?


      A **picklist** is multi-select component that displays a list of selectable options, where more than one item can be selected. It is displayed as two listboxes side-by-side, where the user can move items across from left to right or right to left.

      ### When and why


      A picklist is similar to a multi-select list, in that it allows the user to select multiple items from a list of possible options.  The picklist however moves the selected items in to a separate list.  This allows the user to clearly see what has been selected and potentially have the ability to reorder the selected items.

      ## Using a picklist


      * The picklist should have a label to describe what the user is selecting.

      * Each listbox should have a label to describe the list.

      * When user selects an item it should be indicated by the selector being ticked.

      * Each listbox, if displaying 10 items or more, should include a filter.

      * An individual item should only appear in one of the listboxes.
