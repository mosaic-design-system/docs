    body: "## Accessibility in Mosaic


      The Mosaic team are passionate about making sure every one of our
      products is fully inclusive and offers the very best user experience for
      all of our users.\ 


      A great path to achieving usability across the whole spectrum of our
      users is following the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. We are trying our hardest
      to follow these guidelines as closely as we can to ensure Mosaic is as
      accessible as possible, but in some areas this is not currently possible
      due to things like technology limitations. Making content accessible is a
      continual process, and we are working towards making every single
      component, pattern and guideline as accessible possible – as such, if
      something does not currently match these guidelines, you can be sure that
      a plan to achieve that goal is in place across the whole system. Anywhere
      we are not following the guidelines in our products is spelled out in our
      accessibility statements, with a clear plan for how and when we will
      achieve it.

      ## Why is accessibility so important?


      By not working to make your product as accessible as possible, you
      are alienating some potential users of your products. WCAG AA 2.1 is a
      worldwide industry standard, and accessibility statements are an
      incredibly useful tool to be transparent about your efforts to be as
      inclusive as possible – as such, we want to make sure that we are ready to
      show the world how accessible we are, and where we are planning to improve
      and when. This feeds into our ethos that every user is important, no
      matter what their accessibility needs are.


      Remember, Web accessibility is **essential** for people with
      disabilities, but it's **useful** for everyone.

      ## So, what do we mean by accessible?


      To create accessible products, we must first understand why it's
      important. To Advanced, an accessible product aims to achieve the
      following two principles:


      * We endeavour to try and give every user the same benefits,
      regardless of ability or who they are

      * We want our products to be able to adapt to any type of user in
      any environment, and in any context

      \ \ 

      Accessibility does just encompass people who struggle with vision,
      or can't use a mouse. Often, designers fall into the trap of only thinking
      about permanent physical disabilities when making decisions about their
      designs. It's important to remember there are other forms of disability
      which are not only about someone's physical capabilities, but also their
      environment or situation. Accessibility can also apply to short-term,
      temporary and/or invisible factors.


      The four types of disability that need to be considered are as
      follows:


      | **Type** | **Description** |

      | --- | --- |

      | **Situational** | Examples of this include a brightly lit room or
      area where a person with 'typical' vision is working could affect how easy
      a screen is to view. Similarly, someone in a busy office may not be able
      to listen to audio or have their sound on. |

      | **Temporary** | An injury to a hand or an arm (or even an eye!)
      may prevent someone from using a mouse, keyboard, or screen for a short
      time, but they will be able to use them once they have recovered. |

      | **Permanent** | This is what most of us think of when talking
      about \"disability.\" An accessibility issue that affects how the user can
      interact with our software on a permanent basis. This covers things like
      blindness, dyslexia, and MS. |

      | **Invisible** | Some accessibility issues are not always visible,
      this includes diseases like chrons, colitis, mental health issues, types
      of pain and many more. When looking at someone with an invisible issue,
      you may not be immediately obvious that they have accessibility needs. |


      It is important to note that accessibility issues do not always fall
      into one category. For example, someone recovering from a brain injury
      would have an issue that was both invisible and temporary.


      \r

      Accessible design doesn't just offer a better experience to users
      with accessibility considerations; a truly good user experience is fully
      inclusive for everyone **no matter who they are**.\r\n"
