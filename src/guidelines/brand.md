## Introduction

Product branding ensures a clear identity that represents our core values. This helps us work towards a unified customer journey and experience for our users, whilst also allowing our Marketing teams to differentiate us from competitors.

This is simplified by our mission statement – “Making a Difference” – and that is at the core of the Mosaic philosophy. It is about making a difference, not only for our product teams, but by delivering changes to the overall product experience for the benefit of our end users.

You can view the extended brand guidelines on the Advanced Hub \[link to the Hub]. However, not all of these apply to Mosaic and our product interfaces, so the following sections explain the key points.
