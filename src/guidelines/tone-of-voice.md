    body: "## Introduction


      This guide is designed to provide guidance on how copy should be
      written in the absence of a specifically provided message. On this tab,
      you will find the outlines for our products' **voice** and **tone** – a
      consistent style of messaging across our product suite. Use it as a
      playbook when you're writing copy in the products, and let it serve as
      inspiration to keep things consistent.

      \r

      This is **not** a guide on how to write an e-mail to a customer -
      this guide should purely be used for messaging within one of our products.
      Our “brand” identity is similar to the identity we have within the
      products, but they are not identical.


      \r

      ### What's the difference between voice and tone?


      **Voice** and **Tone** are two very similar concepts, and are
      intrinsically linked. There are some subtle differences, though.

      \r

      The **Voice** of a products are what it says. Much like you have
      your own way of putting things, Mosaic also has its own way of putting
      things. It's the difference between saying \"Hi\", and saying
      \"Salutations\". \"Indeed\" or \"Agreed\". \"Woke\" or \"Socially
      conscious\".\ 

      \r

      The **Tone** of our product is similar to the **Voice**, but there
      are some key differences. You have your own personal voice, and your voice
      doesn't change – but, depending on the situation, your tone will change.
      Speaking to a close family member will definitely be different to speaking
      to a colleague (I hope). It also changes depending on the situation at
      hand – your tone will immediately change in an emergency. The same goes
      for a product. Reminding a user than they need to fill a mandatory field
      when submitting a form will have a vastly different tone to telling them
      that the system has encountered a critical error and they need to phone
      support immediately.\r


      <hr>


      ## The Voice of Mosaic


      Our voice is **human** but **professional**. We don’t want to treat
      our users like unfamiliar strangers and bark orders at them, but being too
      casual is just as bad. Our products saying: “Ah, saved that for you mate,
      no problem!” comes across as far too casual, but equally, “You must save
      this form.” is incredibly unfriendly. Users of Mosaic products should
      enjoy the experience, feel welcome, and have a **human** interaction – and
      also feel confident that their business needs are being treated with care
      and due diligence. Our products are expert solutions from a trusted
      source. We aren't just professionals: we are the professionals.

      \r

      But… What does this actually mean? When writing copy, you should
      strive to make it…

      * **Focused**


      We play an important role in our users' work. The user has come to
      us to solve a problem, and we chose our words carefully to do that
      quickly, and efficiently. We simplify things as much as possible, and
      don't waste time over-complicating things that simply don't need it.


      * **Genuine**


      Our users are people with a need, not clients. We don't have to keep
      them at arm's length, or maintain a business-like persona, or treat every
      interaction as a transaction. We're not looking for validation or seeking
      to impress. Our products have a collaborative relationship with our users
      – do away with pretence and get on with the job at hand. We don't worry
      about looking smart or keeping up appearances – we get to the point and
      say what we mean.


      * **Insightful**


      Our users are the experts, but so are we. Our products should
      inspire confidence in our users – we know what we're doing. Language
      should be appropriate for the task at hand, especially when it comes to
      sector-specific knowledge, and it should show the users that they can
      trust us to do the job right. Be confident. Be assertive. Make it clear we
      know what we're doing. But never be aggressive or smug.


      <hr>


      ## The Tone of Mosaic


      Mosaic's tone is largely **friendly** and **encouraging**. We know
      that our products are used in hectic and important work environments, so
      we strive to put the user at ease. We use an everyday conversational tone
      in our products to achieve this. We are helpful, encouraging, and are
      there to support the user in every step of the way.


      * **Encouraging**


      Not all of our users are confident with tech. Nor will they always
      be 100% certain about how to complete a job. Some might even have no idea
      what they're looking for. That's fine – we're here to show them, and
      reassure them they're on the right track. Our tone reassures the user, and
      encourages them to make decisions with confidence. We might even
      occasionally pat them on the back for a job well done.\ 


      * **Approachable**


      Users should never feel alienated by our products. The language
      should be simple to understand, and everything should always be clear. We
      shouldn't worry them, or admonish them for doing something a wrong. Our
      products should guide them down the right path with a gentle hand, and
      encourage them to feel relaxed and at ease.



      * **Personable**



      Finally, our voice is friendly. Our products are a collaborator, not
      a service. Our relationship is not business-to-business, it's
      person-to-person. A user should never feel like they are interacting with
      a machine, they should instead feel like they're working on a project with
      a co-worker.

      ## Finding Our Voice


      Okay, now you know what our voice is. It's **friendly**, but it's
      **professional**. Our voice inspires confidence, but feels like a member
      of a team. How can you be both professional and provide a genuine
      connection? Read on to find a few pointers to help you achieve our tone of
      voice.\r

      If you ever aren't sure, you are encouraged to contact the UX
      Copywriter:\r

      samuel.bright@oneadvanced.com\r

      Achieving a **professional**, **approachable**, and **friendly**
      tone of voice can be done in a few different ways:\r


      ### Be efficient, but don't cut corners\r

      * **Use full sentences**\r

      * **Do not use slang** \r

      * **Treat the user's time with respect**\r


      Avoid the usage of “lazy” language in all instances. This includes
      things like slang and turns of phrase. Slang and
      [idioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) may shorten the message you
      need to deliver, but it will come across as sloppy and lacking in
      professionalism. Copy in our products should always be complete sentences,
      where possible, and use proper English.

      \ \r

      This is a difficult habit to break, and I am sure you will smile
      once or twice while reading this document when you notice I have not
      followed my own advice - but that is because it is hard to avoid. We
      naturally write in our own tone of voice, even when being professional,
      and the vast majority of people use slang all the time and \"don't speak
      proper English\". The most annoying part? It's normally grammatically
      correct, and most word processors will not pick it up reliably. The
      easiest way of making sure you do not do this is getting somebody else to
      look over your copy before publishing it.\r




      <details class=\"mcc-accordion mcc-card mcc-card--high-emphasis\">

      \  <summary>

      \    <span class=\"mcc-accordion__label\">Obviously I'm not going to
      use slang! ...Right?</span>

      \    <mcc-icon class=\"mcc-accordion__caret mu-ml-auto\"

      \  </summary>

      \  <div class=\"mcc-accordion__body\">

      \    <p>Some slang is really obvious. I, a Devonian, do not blink
      twice when I hear someone call a woodlouse a “chickypig”. But, I am fully
      aware that me using that word in the company of someone not from the
      fertile south would be met with confusion. This is the kind of confusion
      we want to avoid in our products - using a term for something that is not
      universally applicable. It also adds to the professional tone of voice -
      we would not call an invalid URL a “dead link” for example.


      However, some slang is sneaky. Sometimes, we go our whole lives
      knowing a word, without realising that it is actually a slang word. This
      is really difficult to “learn” how to avoid: if you do not know something
      is slang, you are not going to question it. Here are a couple of
      applicable examples:



      *\t**Phone support** - this is slang. “Phone” is not a verb. Well,
      it is. Sort of. It is in the dictionary and most people would know what
      you mean, but it is a widely-used informal word. This is an example where
      we are less worried about the loss of meaning, and are more worried about
      the impression its usage gives. The “correct” words are “telephone” or
      “call”. It would be much better to say “Call support” for this example.


      *\t**Click the button** - another sneaky slang word. “Click” comes
      from the sound the mouse button makes when you press it - also, it is not
      a very inclusive term, what if someone is using a tablet, or keyboard
      controls? Really, this should be “select/press the button”.\ 


      There is not an easy answer for this one, and mostly this will come
      down to other people spotting your mistakes and correcting them. Most
      people have a gauge of what language is informal and formal, and this
      generally comes from an innate sense of what is slang and what is not -
      so, in best practice, if something feels “too informal”, double check it
      and ask someone else to take a look.

      \  <div class=\"mcc-accordion__body\">

      \    <p>In short, no. This style guide is not going to be an A-Z of
      how to write proper English. Language is expressive, nuanced, and not
      standardised. Hence, why we have a **style guide**, not a ruleset. What I
      think of as ‘correct’, others will disagree with. There are basics, sure,
      but the scope is far too huge for me to cover here. Throughout, I will be
      giving some common misconceptions and easy mistakes, but in all likelihood
      your grammar is not going to be perfect…


      \r

      and that is fine! Anyone that tells you they have perfect grammar is
      lying or trying far harder than they need to be. I definitely make
      mistakes. Sure, perfect grammar makes us look super fancy and really
      professional… But, the English language evolves. Perfect grammar is not a
      requirement in the 21st century, and it can be quite easily argued that
      what people think of as “good grammar” is outdated. A lot of the time,
      “good grammar” makes reading more difficult, unless you know grammar
      really well. We have a diverse range of users who respond differently to
      levels of reading complexity, and honestly: I prefer something being
      understandable to it being correct. Semi-colons are confusing, they stick
      out. Oxford commas are technically correct, but people look at them and
      smile to themselves because they think they have spotted a mistake. Nobody
      really knows (or cares) if you should use “whom” instead of “who”. We want
      the meaning to be clear - “good grammar” comes second to that. In
      addition, being overly formal and having perfect grammar is going to make
      the products feel unapproachable and inhuman.\r


      Controversial opinion, I know, especially from a copywriter, but our
      goal here is to make language accessible, understandable, consistent, and
      readable. For the most part you do not need to worry about grammar beyond
      the basics. And, get ready for a phrase you will hear a lot: **you should
      get somebody to double-check your copy**. Any huge grammar mistakes can
      and will be easily rectified.\r


      </p>

      \  </div>

      </details>


      However – keep in mind the user's time is their most valuable asset.
      Writing wonderfully beautiful prose with nary a mistake in our products is
      all well and good – but don't overdo it. Be clear, straightforward, and
      don't waffle. Write your system message, then see if you can cut the word
      count in half without losing meaning or sentence structure. It's a hard
      skill to master, but definitely possible.


      \r

      ### **Mind your P’s and Q’s**


      \r

      Our products should be polite to the users - a simple “please” or
      “thank you” adds a personality to the products, and will go a long way to
      helping the user feel their time is valued. It is a small thing that adds
      a lot of value to copy.\r


      * **Be polite**

      * **Appreciate the user**

      * **Be careful of structure**


      Whenever a user is asked to perform an action in a long-form
      message, something that is longer than 3 or 4 words, then we should
      include “Please” in the sentence. This is appropriate for things that are
      outside a user’s normal workflow and not immediately obvious - “press
      submit” doesn't require a please, but “Your changes haven't been saved
      yet. Please press the save button before leaving the page.” should. This
      can lead to some dodgy sentence structures, so refer to the expandable
      note below for guidance.\ 


      \r

      Similarly - we should thank a user for their time! When appropriate.
      Thanking them for every single step they take within our products will get
      very stale very quickly. A “thank you” should be reserved for actions
      outside of a common workflow, or when the product has been “given”
      something by the user. For example, after a user sends a bug report or
      submits a form, they should be thanked. \r


      <details class=\"mcc-accordion mcc-card mcc-card--high-emphasis\">

      \  <summary>

      \    <span class=\"mcc-accordion__label\">Can you tell me how to ask
      someone to do something, please?</span>

      \    <mcc-icon class=\"mcc-accordion__caret mu-ml-auto\"
      name=\"angle_down\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></mcc-icon>

      \  </summary>

      \  <div class=\"mcc-accordion__body\">

      \    <p>Instructions that the user is given should include a
      “Please” at the start of the sentence in the vast majority of cases, to
      avoid grammatical errors. Ending a sentence with please requires a comma,
      and it takes up valuable screen space and sometimes requires an entirely
      separate clause in the sentence. Take the two following examples:


      \r

      1.\tPlease press submit


      \r

      2.\tPress submit please


      \r

      Example 2 should actually read “Press submit, please”. But - imagine
      that in a modal? Imagine it without a full-stop. Example 1 works fine as a
      message without a full-stop, but “Press submit, please” looks very strange
      without a full-stop.


      \r

      This is a problem that is extremely context-sensitive, and the
      answer to most of the problems that arise is “it works fine with the
      please at the beginning”. It will not work in all sentence structures, ask
      somebody to double check when in doubt.\r


      </p>

      \  </div>

      </details>


      ### Elegance in Simplicity


      There is a tendency to overcomplicate a matter when you know the
      inner nuts and bolts of a product. “Booking an absence” may well
      technically be “submitting an absence request”, but the user does not care
      what is happening under the hood of the product. Complex concepts need to
      be broken down into their simplest parts. \r


      The copy in our products needs to be **clear** and **concise**.
      Users use our product to cut down on time so they can do their job more
      efficiently. We are helping them solve a business need - we should strive
      to make that as easy as possible. If a user reads something in our
      products and needs to think for a moment to work out what that means, we
      are doing our job badly. Often this comes about from us (as the creators
      of a product) becoming supremely familiar with workflows and steps taken
      to achieving a process - the user does not care how it happens, they just
      care about the result.


      \r

      Unnecessary detail needs to be stripped out of messaging. Take the
      above example: if a user wants to book an absence, they want to book an
      absence. They don't want to submit an absence request. Call a spade a
      spade, not a utensil for moving soil.\r


      Context also plays a role in this. Sometimes, we provide much more
      detail than is necessary. Surprisingly, we can give our users some credit
      when it comes to reading between the lines. If the context of piece of
      copy does some of the heavy-lifting, we do not need to reiterate that
      message. For example, if we were submitting a timesheet for a user, we may
      be tempted to write a message saying: “[Person X]'s timesheet for [Week Y]
      has been successfully submitted”. A simple “Timesheet has been
      successfully submitted.” will suffice - the user knows that they have just
      been filling out a timesheet for Person X in Week Y, they do not need to
      be reminded.


      \r

      **However**, accuracy is also important. Do not skip over important
      elements of a message because it is quicker to not mention them. But, be
      wary that it is possible to be too accurate. General beats specific,
      unless specificity is important.\r


      ### Target Audience


      * **Prioritise clarity over style**

      * **Identify and understand your expected users**

      * **Use jargon where appropriate**


      When writing copy within products, your end-user should always be at
      the forefront of your mind. Useful copy is more important than beautiful
      copy. When you are creating your system messages, you must consider who
      will be reading them. \r


      Professionals in different industries will have different
      expectations of the software they are using, in particular around things
      like formality and complexity. Copy should be catered to these individuals
      - users that using our products aimed at the legal sector would expect a a
      lot of industry-specific terminology and common parlance, for example.
      This will be vastly different to a product aimed at a wider range of users
      like one of our HCM products. The ‘feel’ of these products should remain
      largely the same - to preserve the Advanced product identity - which will
      be achieved through the tone of voice guidelines above; however, while
      writing copy you should be aware that different users have different
      needs. This will be mostly achieved by how you approach **Jargon** within
      the products.\r


      **Jargon** is a series of words that are associated with a niche
      community of people - for example, those interested in a particular hobby
      will know the ins-and-outs of their hobby and either use short-hand or
      specialised terms that will only make sense to them. For example, within
      the tech community, most developers would know that ‘rubber-ducking’ is
      explaining to a rubber duck how their code works, in order to go through a
      process one step at a time and hopefully spot a problem. This is the same
      within the industries we aim our products at. You should hopefully be
      aware of the kind of jargon used within the industry you are currently
      working with, and there are a few guidelines below on how best to use
      these.\r


      #### Industry Jargon


      * **Not all users speak the same language**


      Users of our HCM products are not always guaranteed to be
      particularly familiar with HR processes, so it needs to be approachable
      for someone who is not aware of those. On the other hand, we can be
      confident that somebody using our financial solutions will know what a pay
      period is. Jargon is encouraged when it is industry-specific terminology
      that a professional in that sector can be expected to know - as long as
      that professional is the expected user of the product. If this is
      ambiguous, then we need to take care in how we use jargon. \r


      Take, for example, a fictional product that allows an employee of a
      company to record their worked hours into a timesheet, and gives them an
      expected payslip. That timesheet is then submitted to the payroll
      administrator for their company, who works their financial magic on it to
      pay them. We have two users here - the employee, and the payroll
      administrator. The payroll administrator will probably use things like the
      employee’s full-time equivalent salary and their tax code, and also worry
      about additions and deductions to the employee’s pay, and enter values for
      their holiday pay and statutory sick pay… stuff that sounds like
      accounting wizardry to a layman. In this instance, the target audience for
      the two separate parts of the product are vastly different. Jargon must be
      applied differently in these two scenarios, catering for the end user. If
      it is not reasonable to assume that a user knows an industry-specific
      term, then either it should not be used, or an explanation should be
      provided.\r


      #### Technical Jargon


      * **Have an awareness that you are a tech expert, but your user is
      not**


      One thing we cannot be sure about, however, is the computer-literacy
      of the end user. We, as employees of a tech company working in the
      software industry, know far more than the layman about how our products
      work. We are comfortable using specialised terms for areas of our
      products, as it is ubiquitous language among our colleagues - but, our
      users (probably) are not well-versed in this kind of terminology. \r


      It is absolutely best to avoid technical jargon wherever possible. A
      message that says something like ‘the function was unsuccessful due to
      this technical error’ will mean little to a regular user, but ‘We could
      not do that because your X is not Y' tells them exactly what they need to
      know. It may be reasonable to surmise that most in the 21st century are
      familiar with topics like that, but we cannot assume. Technical problems
      within our products need to be explained simply to the user to avoid
      alienating them. The worst outcome would be our user being presented with
      an incomprehensible mess of technical detail, and having no idea what they
      are looking at - this would discourage them from using the product. \r\n"
