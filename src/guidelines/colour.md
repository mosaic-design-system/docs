## Introduction

Our colour palette is an important part of how we present ourselves. Our pages are kept clean and free from unnecessary colour to ensure focus is always on the content and its associated actions. Too much on a page can lead to confusion and cause users to overlook important information. Therefore, we have intentionally aimed to reduce the amount of "visual noise" by using our carefully considered palette, while adding splashes of colour to help with signposting and engagement.

Our palette is also aligned with the WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements for colour contrast, so that users with visual impairments are able to perceive content on our pages. For more information, please refer to [Accessibility](/guidelines/accessibility).

Below you will find examples and explanations of the colours we have chosen to use in the Mosaic Design System.
