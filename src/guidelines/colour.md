## Introduction

Our colour palette is an important part of how we present ourselves. Our pages are kept clean and free from unnecessary colour to ensure focus is always on the content and its associated actions. Too much on a page can lead to confusion and overlooking important information. We have therefore intentionally aimed to reduce the amount of "visual noise" by using our carefully considered palette, while adding splashes of colour to help with signposting and engagement.

We have also aligned our palette with the WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements for colour contrast so that users with visual impairments are able to perceive content on our pages. For more information, please refer to Accessibility \[link to Accessibility page].

The sections below explain the colours we have chosen to use in Mosaic. 

## Greyscale colours

The greyscale palette is our base palette and used for the default font colours and most UI elements such as, borders, dividers, surface backgrounds, etc. It comprises 14 colours including black and white. This provides an extremely flexible palette to work with.

## Font colours

The colours chosen for fonts have been selected for their readability and accessibility. The primary font colour used for headings and body text is almost black, which is easy to read against any of our surface backgrounds. Similarly, our secondary font colour, which is used for subtitles, is also highly legible.

\[swatches]

In addition to the main font colours described above, we have colours for links which are also aligned with colour use in web applications and support for accessibility. The active link colour is blue and the visited link colour is purple.

## Primary colour

The primary colour is used for the main call-to-actions (CTAs) on a page, like adding or importing. Wherever possible, there should only be one primary coloured action on a page. However, some components and UI elements also use this as an accent colour to promote a cohesive visual experience.

\[swatches]

## Secondary colour

The secondary colour is used for CTAs with less priority in the overall hierarchy of the page, like closing a dialog or cancelling a form. These may sit alongside a primary action or placed inline, next to the content to which it relates.

## Contextual colours

The contextual colours are used to support specific actions, statuses, or outcomes. They provide an additional layer of visual information to help users understand how your product has or will interpret their decisions. However, contextual colours must always be accompanied by text labels, icons, or both, as colour alone will not be conveyed to all users. For more information, please refer to Accessibility \[link to Accessibility page].

Our contextual colours are named:

* Primary
* Success
* Danger
* Warning
* Info

### Primary

As mentioned above, this colour is reserved for the main CTA on a page, like adding or importing. Wherever possible, there should only be one Primary coloured action on a page, dialog, or sheet.

\[swatches]

### Success

This colour is used to indicate positive items, like Save or Accept buttons or Completed indicators. It reinforces that the action or status is of a positive nature. For example, a message confirming that an import was performed successfully.

\[swatches]

### Danger

This colour is used to indicate information about dangerous or destructive activities, where failure to take or avoid a specific action could result in the loss of data. It should be clear to users that disregarding such a message may not be reversible. For example, a message stating that a file already exists with the same name and overwriting cannot be undone.

\[swatches]

### Warning

This colour is used to indicate information essential to the completion of a task, which may require confirmation or a recommended course of action. Users should not be allowed to ignore warnings and still complete a task. For example, a message warning that a file is too big to be imported and should be compressed.

\[swatches]

### Info

This colour is used to indicate neutral or advisory information, which provide details that either apply to regular day-to-day usage or relates to special conditions. Users can ignore this context with no impact. For example, a message recommending the size for images before importing.
