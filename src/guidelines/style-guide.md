    body: "This guide will talk you through the different way text should be
      formatted and presented throughout our products. Reading through these
      guidelines is essential to making sure that our products are consistent
      across the whole suite.\r

      \r

      This document won't tell you what to write – you can find that in
      the [Tone of Voice](/guidelines/tone-of-voice) article – but instead how
      to write something, i.e. what to capitalise, how to format a table, etc.


      \r

      \r

      Consistent voice, tone, and style will create an environment where
      our users are put at ease, and become familiar with the products and know
      what to expect. It's like them learning 'our' language – they will quickly
      begin to understand us, and cross-product usage will become quick and
      easy.


      \r

      \r

      This guide is broken down into several tabs, which each cover a
      major area of styling your copy:


      \r

      \r

      [Conventions](/guidelines/style-guide/#conventions) details the
      standard way we use the rarer parts of copy, like acronyms, currencies,
      dates, et cetera. Visit this tab to learn about things that are a bit more
      complicated than writing a simple instruction.


      \r

      \r

      [Formatting](/guidelines/style-guide/#formatting) covers how to
      style your text. Things like when to underline and when to use colour are
      covered here.


      \r

      \r

      [Punctuation](/guidelines/style-guide/#punctuation) will instruct
      you on how to use punctuation properly. This is more in-depth than when to
      use a full-stop, it details where we stand on things like the usage of
      ampersands (&) and whether or not to use an oxford comma.


      \r

      \r

      [Quality](/guidelines/style-guide/#quality) describes the impact of
      good-quality copy and how to achieve that.

      \ \r

      \r

      [Structure](/guidelines/style-guide/#structure) deals with how to
      lay out copy on a page. Go here for guidance on things like when to use a
      subtitle, and dealing with white space.\r\n"
  - title: Conventions
    body: "## Abbreviations


      An abbreviation is when you shorten a word, i.e. using Hr. instead
      of hour. In general, the usage of abbreviations should be avoided – they
      can often get confusing. As an example, using Hr. for hour might be
      confusing in Cloud HR!


      If an abbreviation is absolutely necessary for a page to work (for
      example, when space is limited), they are allowed – this should be avoided
      as best as possible, however.\ 


      ### Ampersands


      Ampersands (&) should only ever be used when referring to an entity
      with an ampersand in the name (e.g. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell).\ 


      In rare cases, they may be used in places like tables where space is
      limited. If you do choose to use ampersands in this way, make sure it is
      consistent on the same page - it's very confusing to have a table that
      uses both 'and' & an ampersand and seems to use it interchangeably and
      without warning & logic. That sentence read really weirdly, didn't it?


      ## Initialisms and Acronyms


      Did you know there’s a difference between an initialism and an
      acronym?\ 


      An **Initialism** is where a phrase or name is shortened into the
      first letter of each word, but spoken still spoken as letters (i.e.
      **E**uropean **U**nion becomes the **EU**).


      An **Acronym** is similar in that it takes the first letter of each
      word in a name or phrase and forms a shortened version of the word, but it
      is spoken as a new word (**S**elf-**c**ontained **u**nderwater
      **b**reathing **a**pparatus becomes ‘SCUBA’).




      ### Initialisms


      Whenever you use an **Initialism**, it should be formatted as a
      series of uninterrupted capital letters, i.e. PDF not P.D.F.


      An initialism should be qualified the first time you use it in a
      user journey if it is not ubiquitous to remove ambiguity (you can find a
      list of ubiquitous terminology in our reference section). To qualify an
      initialism, you should write out the full phrase and then provide the
      initialism in brackets afterwards. For example, if you were setting up
      Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), the first time a user sees it they should
      see it as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), and then SMP can be safely used
      throughout the rest of the journey.


      ### Acronyms


      Similar to abbreviations, acronyms should be used sparingly.
      However, they can be very effective to shorten a long term that is
      repeated often. An example of this is a \"Keep In Touch day\" in payroll –
      it can be very useful to shorten this to \"KIT day\" on the KIT day
      management screen.


      Whenever an abbreviation is used, the first time it is used on a
      page or workflow should include the phrase in full, followed by the
      abbreviation in brackets, i.e.:


      \"To book a Keep In Touch day (KIT day), open the…\"


      Additionally, you do not need to use full stops after each letter of
      an acronym – it is NATO, not N.A.T.O.


      You are free to use acronyms if they are very common, i.e. things
      like i.e. and e.g., without qualifying them.


      ## Capital letters


      PLEASE DON'T SHOUT AT THE USERS. Writing copy in all-caps makes text
      very difficult to read, and is not necessary. If something requires urgent
      attention, you can use other methods to call attention to it (such as
      modals, highlights, disabling buttons, etc.)


      ## Currencies


      When writing a currency, always use numbers to display the value,
      and currency symbols always go before the number, not after.


      You should also use a comma to separate large values (e.g. £1,500)
      and smaller denominations (such as pence) follow the integer value with a
      decimal point, and do not require a currency symbol (e.g. £1.50, not
      £1.50p)


      Ranges only require a single currency symbol, e.g. £100-200.\ 


      ## Time


      We use 24-hour times across our products in general. There are
      exceptions to this when it comes to denoting time periods - for example in
      CloudHR you can book annual leave “Starting in the AM” and “Finishing in
      the PM”.\ 


      Unless there is a strong reason not to, you should use 24-hour time
      as a default. 24-hour time is the 'default' because of the slight
      implication that 24-hour time appears more accurate. In reality, this
      isn’t true, however it appears more professional and eliminates absolutely
      any ambiguity (is 12PM midnight or midday?).


      However: if possible, you should give your users the choice. Some
      users will strongly prefer one over the other, and there isn't really a
      reason we shouldn't give them the choice. This should also be done at the
      user level, not organisation level. Some forms of dyslexia mean 24-hour
      time is difficult to read, and some users from different backgrounds will
      have grown up using different forms of time. If the product can be
      tailored to the user’s personal preferences, it should be.


      ### 24-hour Time


      HOUR:MINUTE - we separate the hour and the minute with a colon, e.g.
      13:30 would be half past one in the afternoon.\ 


      Midnight is the start - midnight should always be 00:00, not 24:00
      (Seems obvious, but I have seen some people write it as 12:00 AM which is
      frankly baffling).


      Always at least four numbers - 1am to 9am still need to include the
      minutes, i.e. 01:00 or 23:59. You can add a 5th and 6th digit to include
      seconds: 10:00:52 if required.


      ### 12-hour Time


      12-hour is formatted with colons between each value – i.e.
      \"hour:minute:seconds AM/PM\".\ 


      Also note that \"AM\" and \"PM\" are always capitalised and are
      separated from the time value with a space.


      ### Time ranges


      When you need to write a time range, the start and finish should
      always be separated by a hyphen and spaces. Including the space shows a
      visual distinction between the two times and reduces confusion, i.e.


      13:00 – 15:00


      9AM – 3PM


      ## Dates


      Below is a table outlining how and when to use different date
      formats across the products, and how to include time in them. An easy rule
      to remember when writing the date is the hierarchy, going from most
      specific (time) to least specific (year).\

      ## Industry Terms\r

      \r


      Industry terms must be used consistently across your product, and
      you need to be mindful of the users in question when including them. You
      can read more in the [Tone of
      Voice](/guidelines/tone-of-voice/#finding-our-voice) guidelines. \r

      \r


      ## Labels\r

      \r


      Text labels should be used throughout your product any time you have
      an element that can be interacted with (i.e. a **Button** or form field).
      Ideally, they should be no more than one or two words long, and they
      should provide the context for their purpose.\r

      \r


      Labels should stick to familiar and meaningful phrases, such as
      ‘Save’ and ‘Contact us’.\r

      \r


      Labels should also be in sentence case. \r

      \r


      You should try and remain consistent when labelling throughout, and
      avoid using different terminology for the same action on different pages.
      If you use ‘Cancel’ on one modal, it should stay as ‘Cancel’ on other ones
      and not change to ‘Close’. \r

      \r


      If you have many similar labels on a page, consider eliminating the
      redundancies. For example, if a user is on a tab labelled ‘Client’ and
      they are filling out form fields that describe the client’s details, you
      do not need to name each field ‘Client forename’, ‘Client surname’, and
      ‘Client address’. You could simply put ‘Forename’, ‘Surname’ and
      ‘Address’.\r

      \r


      ## Links\r

      \r


      Links are a really useful way of helping your user on their journey
      through the process. If you are talking about another area of the product,
      consider linking to that area within the text. \r

      \r


      Links should also be readable by screen-readers and should not be an
      instruction. The copy making up the display text of the link should be
      descriptive of where it leads, and shouldn’t say things like “click here
      to book an absence”. Instead, that should simply say “book an absence” and
      visually look like a link. Links shouldn’t be ambiguous as to where they
      lead, and you should take care to make them succinct and informative. \r

      \r


      ## Numbers\r

      \r


      If a number is on its own in a body of text, there are a few things
      you need to consider:\r

      \r


      - Zero to nine should be written out in full, (one, two, three
      etc.), but 10+ should be written out as digits. Three hundred and two
      thousand six hundred and twenty nine is really difficult to read, 302,629
      is much easier.\r

      \r


      - Ranges should be separated by a hyphen (1,000-2,000), and ranges
      that include a suffix (such as those with a unit of measurement or a
      percentage sign) only need to include the suffix at the end of the
      upper-range digit (i.e. 5-10 minutes, 65-82%).\r

      \r


      - When you get to numbers with four or more digits, every 4th digit
      from the right should be separated from the previous three by a comma
      (i.e. 1,532,301). This promotes readability and helps users who struggle
      to read large numbers separate the separate parts of the number out. In
      the previous example, they can see the *millions*, *thousands* and
      *hundreds* of the number.\r

      - Numbers that precede units of measurement should always be written
      out in digits, even when <10 (i.e. 3KB or 5m).\r

      - Percentages always use digits, and are followed immediately by the

    body: "## Bold text\r

      \r

      **Bolded text** is allowed within products as long as you are
      emphasising a small amount of the text. Bolding should be reserved for
      small pieces of **key information**. This can include things like dates or
      names. \r

      \r


      Ensure you do not overuse bolded text, as it can be jarring for the
      user if there are multiple bolded words across a single paragraph. \r

      \r


      Outside of a product, such as in supporting documentation and
      customer communications, bolding should be used for the names of products
      and their features. This is to indicate to the reader that you are
      referring to something **specific** within the product, and not something
      generic. For example, in **Cloud HR**, an **Absence** (as in a booked
      period of time off work within the **Cloud HR** system) should be bolded
      to differentiate it from an absence in general. \r

      \r

      Headings and subheadings should always be bolded, and bolding can be
      used in bullet points to promote a visual hierarchy in your copy.\r

      \r


      ## Italics\r

      \r


      *Italicised text* should be used sparingly. Research suggests that
      large blocks of italics are very difficult to read for dyslexic users. In
      addition, italicising large blocks of text defeats the point of italics,
      which is to draw attention to something that is different from its
      surrounding parts.\r

      \r


      Small pieces of copy (10 words or less) can be italicised to
      differentiate them from other blocks of text on the page. This might be
      appropriate for small notes highlighting something on a page, like a note
      matched with some text by an asterisk (*) that is qualified further down
      the page.\r

      \r


      Italics should also be used to refer to entities not related to
      Advanced, such as government bodies (*HMRC*) or the name of a book or
      journal (*The Sunday Times*). Quotes should also be written in italics.\r

      \r


      ## Underline\r

      \r


      Do not <u>underline</u> text for emphasis. It may confuse users who
      are expecting a hyperlink. Headers shouldn’t be underlined either, they
      should use a larger font and be bolded.\r

      \r


      ## Colour\r

      \r


      [The original style guide ok’d colouring text, but I don’t think
      this is accessible? Have included the text here just in case it is, but
      I’m not sure.]\r

      \r


      Colour is a good way to emphasise things. However, don't use too
      much colour, as a proportion of your readers may be colour blind and may
      not see the highlighted bits. Also, if a user changes their Windows colour
      scheme, the colours used may not be displayed as intended. Colours should
      be taken from the Mosaic colour palette.


      ## Bullet points\r

      \r

      Bullet points can be used within your products to create lists of
      information or options. However, you must ensure the underlying code meets
      [accessibility guidelines for screen readers](
      https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/).\r

      \r

      Whenever you use bullet points, ensure they are introduced with a
      colon (:) that immediately follows the last letter of the last word in the
      preceding copy:\r

      \r

      -\tThis list is introduced with a colon\r

      \r

      Seriously, don’t forget the colon!\r

      \r

      -\tThis list was not introduced with a colon, whoops\r

      \r

      Each list item in a bullet point list should also begin with a
      capital letter, and should not end in a full stop:\r

      \r

      -\tList item 1 is correct\r

      -\tlist item 2 is incorrect.\r

      \r

      However, longer list items that require intermediary punctuation
      should be finished with a full stop:\r

      \r

      -\tLonger list items break the rules. If it contains a full stop,
      then it should end with one as well so you don’t have a trailing sentence
      that don’t seem to end.\r
