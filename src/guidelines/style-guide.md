    body: "This guide will talk you through the different way text content should be
      formatted and presented throughout our products. Reading through these
      guidelines is essential to making sure that our products are consistent
      across the whole suite.\r

      \r

      This document won't tell you what to write – you can find that in
      [Tone of voice](/guidelines/tone-of-voice) – but instead how to write
      something, i.e. what to capitalise, how to format a table, etc.


      \r

      \r

      Consistent voice, tone, and style will create an environment where
      our users are put at ease, and become familiar with the products and know
      what to expect. It's like them learning 'our' language – they will quickly
      begin to understand us, and cross-product usage will become quick and
      easy.


      \r

      \r

      This guide is broken down into several tabs, which each cover a
      major area of styling your copy:


      \r

      \r

      [Conventions](/guidelines/style-guide/#conventions) details the
      standard way we use the rarer parts of copy, like acronyms, currencies,
      dates, et cetera. Visit this tab to learn about things that are a bit more
      complicated than writing a simple instruction.


      \r

      \r

      [Formatting](/guidelines/style-guide/#formatting) covers how to
      style your text. Things like when to underline and when to use colour are
      covered here.


      \r

      \r

      [Punctuation](/guidelines/style-guide/#punctuation) will instruct
      you on how to use punctuation properly. This is more in-depth than when to
      use a full-stop, it details where we stand on things like the usage of
      ampersands (&) and whether or not to use an oxford comma.


      \r

      \r

      [Quality](/guidelines/style-guide/#quality) describes the impact of
      good-quality copy and how to achieve that.

      \ \r

      \r

      [Structure](/guidelines/style-guide/#structure) deals with how to
      lay out copy on a page. Go here for guidance on things like when to use a
      subtitle, and dealing with white space.\r\n"
  - title: Conventions
    body: "## Abbreviations


      An abbreviation is when you shorten a word, i.e. using Hr. instead
      of hour. In general, the usage of abbreviations should be avoided – they
      can often get confusing. As an example, using Hr. for hour might be
      confusing in Advanced HR!


      If an abbreviation is absolutely necessary for a page to work (for
      example, when space is limited), they are allowed – this should be avoided
      as best as possible, however.\ 


      ### Ampersands


      Ampersands (&) should only ever be used when referring to an entity
      with an ampersand in the name (e.g. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell).\ 


      In rare cases, they may be used in places like tables where space is
      limited. If you do choose to use ampersands in this way, make sure it is
      consistent on the same page - it's very confusing to have a table that
      uses both 'and' & an ampersand and seems to use it interchangeably and
      without warning & logic. That sentence read really weirdly, didn't it?


      ## Initialisms and Acronyms


      Did you know there’s a difference between an initialism and an
      acronym?\ 


      An **Initialism** is where a phrase or name is shortened into the
      first letter of each word, but spoken still spoken as letters (i.e.
      **E**uropean **U**nion becomes the **EU**).


      An **Acronym** is similar in that it takes the first letter of each
      word in a name or phrase and forms a shortened version of the word, but it
      is spoken as a new word (**S**elf-**c**ontained **u**nderwater
      **b**reathing **a**pparatus becomes ‘SCUBA’).




      ### Initialisms


      Whenever you use an **Initialism**, it should be formatted as a
      series of uninterrupted capital letters, i.e. PDF not P.D.F.


      An initialism should be qualified the first time you use it in a
      user journey if it is not ubiquitous to remove ambiguity (you can find a
      list of ubiquitous terminology in our reference section). To qualify an
      initialism, you should write out the full phrase and then provide the
      initialism in brackets afterwards. For example, if you were setting up
      Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), the first time a user sees it they should
      see it as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), and then SMP can be safely used
      throughout the rest of the journey.


      ### Acronyms


      Similar to abbreviations, acronyms should be used sparingly.
      However, they can be very effective to shorten a long term that is
      repeated often. An example of this is a \"Keep In Touch day\" in payroll –
      it can be very useful to shorten this to \"KIT day\" on the KIT day
      management screen.


      Whenever an abbreviation is used, the first time it is used on a
      page or workflow should include the phrase in full, followed by the
      abbreviation in brackets, i.e.:


      \"To book a Keep In Touch day (KIT day), open the…\"


      Additionally, you do not need to use full stops after each letter of
      an acronym – it is NATO, not N.A.T.O.


      You are free to use acronyms if they are very common, i.e. things
      like i.e. and e.g., without qualifying them.


      ## Capital letters


      PLEASE DON'T SHOUT AT THE USERS. Writing copy in all-caps makes text
      very difficult to read, and is not necessary. If something requires urgent
      attention, you can use other methods to call attention to it (such as
      modals, highlights, disabling buttons, etc.)


      ## Currencies


      When writing a currency, always use numbers to display the value,
      and currency symbols always go before the number, not after.


      You should also use a comma to separate large values (e.g. £1,500)
      and smaller denominations (such as pence) follow the integer value with a
      decimal point, and do not require a currency symbol (e.g. £1.50, not
      £1.50p)


      Ranges only require a single currency symbol, e.g. £100-200.\ 


      ## Time


      We use 24-hour times across our products in general. There are
      exceptions to this when it comes to denoting time periods - for example in
      Advanced HR you can book annual leave “Starting in the AM” and “Finishing
      in the PM”.\ 


      Unless there is a strong reason not to, you should use 24-hour time
      as a default. 24-hour time is the 'default' because of the slight
      implication that 24-hour time appears more accurate. In reality, this
      isn’t true, however it appears more professional and eliminates absolutely
      any ambiguity (is 12PM midnight or midday?).


      However: if possible, you should give your users the choice. Some
      users will strongly prefer one over the other, and there isn't really a
      reason we shouldn't give them the choice. This should also be done at the
      user level, not organisation level. Some forms of dyslexia mean 24-hour
      time is difficult to read, and some users from different backgrounds will
      have grown up using different forms of time. If the product can be
      tailored to the user’s personal preferences, it should be.


      ### 24-hour Time


      HOUR:MINUTE - we separate the hour and the minute with a colon, e.g.
      13:30 would be half past one in the afternoon.\ 


      Midnight is the start - midnight should always be 00:00, not 24:00
      (Seems obvious, but I have seen some people write it as 12:00 AM which is
      frankly baffling).


      Always at least four numbers - 1am to 9am still need to include the
      minutes, i.e. 01:00 or 23:59. You can add a 5th and 6th digit to include
      seconds: 10:00:52 if required.


      ### 12-hour Time


      12-hour is formatted with colons between each value – i.e.
      \"hour:minute:seconds AM/PM\".\ 


      Also note that \"AM\" and \"PM\" are always capitalised and are
      separated from the time value with a space.


      ### Time ranges


      When you need to write a time range, the start and finish should
      always be separated by a hyphen and spaces. Including the space shows a
      visual distinction between the two times and reduces confusion, i.e.


      13:00 – 15:00


      9AM – 3PM


      ## Dates


      Below is a table outlining how and when to use different date
      formats across the products, and how to include time in them. An easy rule
      to remember when writing the date is the hierarchy, going from most
      specific (time) to least specific (year).\

      ## Industry Terms\r

      \r


      Industry terms must be used consistently across your product, and
      you need to be mindful of the users in question when including them. You
      can read more in the [Tone of
      Voice](/guidelines/tone-of-voice/#finding-our-voice) guidelines. \r

      \r


      ## Labels\r

      \r


      Text labels should be used throughout your product any time you have
      an element that can be interacted with (i.e. a **Button** or form field).
      Ideally, they should be no more than one or two words long, and they
      should provide the context for their purpose.\r

      \r


      Labels should stick to familiar and meaningful phrases, such as
      ‘Save’ and ‘Contact us’.\r

      \r


      Labels should also be in sentence case. \r

      \r


      You should try and remain consistent when labelling throughout, and
      avoid using different terminology for the same action on different pages.
      If you use ‘Cancel’ on one modal, it should stay as ‘Cancel’ on other ones
      and not change to ‘Discard’. \r

      \r


      If you have many similar labels on a page, consider eliminating the
      redundancies. For example, if a user is on a tab labelled ‘Client’ and
      they are filling out form fields that describe the client’s details, you
      do not need to name each field ‘Client forename’, ‘Client surname’, and
      ‘Client address’. You could simply put ‘Forename’, ‘Surname’ and
      ‘Address’.\r

      \r


      ## Links\r

      \r


      Links are a really useful way of helping your user on their journey
      through the process. If you are talking about another area of the product,
      consider linking to that area within the text. \r

      \r


      Links should also be readable by screen-readers and should not be an
      instruction. The copy making up the display text of the link should be
      descriptive of where it leads, and shouldn’t say things like “click here
      to book an absence”. Instead, that should simply say “book an absence” and
      visually look like a link. Links shouldn’t be ambiguous as to where they
      lead, and you should take care to make them succinct and informative. \r

      \r


      ## Numbers\r

      \r


      If a number is on its own in a body of text, there are a few things
      you need to consider:\r

      \r


      - Zero to nine should be written out in full, (one, two, three
      etc.), but 10+ should be written out as digits. Three hundred and two
      thousand six hundred and twenty nine is really difficult to read, 302,629
      is much easier.\r

      \r


      - Ranges should be separated by a hyphen (1,000-2,000), and ranges
      that include a suffix (such as those with a unit of measurement or a
      percentage sign) only need to include the suffix at the end of the
      upper-range digit (i.e. 5-10 minutes, 65-82%).\r

      \r


      - When you get to numbers with four or more digits, every 3rd digit
      from the right should be preceded by a comma (i.e. 1,532,301). This
      promotes readability and helps users who struggle to read large numbers
      separate the separate parts of the number out. In the previous example,
      they can see the *millions*, *thousands* and *hundreds* of the number.\r

      \r


      - Numbers that precede units of measurement should always be written
      out in digits, even when <10 (i.e. 3KB or 5m).\r

      \r


      - Percentages always use digits, and are followed immediately by the
      percentage symbol with no space (i.e. 3%).\r\n"
  - title: Formatting
    body: "## Bold text\r

      \r

      **Bolded text** is allowed within products as long as you are
      emphasising a small amount of the text. Bolding should be reserved for
      small pieces of **key information**. This can include things like dates or
      names. \r

      \r


      Ensure you do not overuse bolded text, as it can be jarring for the
      user if there are multiple bolded words across a single paragraph. \r

      \r


      Outside of a product, such as in supporting documentation and
      customer communications, bolding should be used for the names of products
      and their features. This is to indicate to the reader that you are
      referring to something **specific** within the product, and not something
      generic. For example, in **Advanced HR**, an **Absence** (as in a booked
      period of time off work within the **Advanced HR** system) should be
      bolded to differentiate it from an absence in general. \r

      \r

      Headings and subheadings should always be bolded, and bolding can be
      used in bullet points to promote a visual hierarchy in your copy.\r

      \r


      ## Italics\r

      \r


      *Italicised text* should be used sparingly. Research suggests that
      large blocks of italics are very difficult to read for dyslexic users. In
      addition, italicising large blocks of text defeats the point of italics,
      which is to draw attention to something that is different from its
      surrounding parts.\r

      \r


      Small pieces of copy (10 words or less) can be italicised to
      differentiate them from other blocks of text on the page. This might be
      appropriate for small notes highlighting something on a page, like a note
      matched with some text by an asterisk (*) that is qualified further down
      the page.\r

      \r


      Italics should also be used to refer to entities not related to
      Advanced, such as government bodies (*HMRC*) or the name of a book or
      journal (*The Sunday Times*). Quotes should also be written in italics.\r

      \r


      ## Underline\r

      \r


      Do not <u>underline</u> text for emphasis. It may confuse users who
      are expecting a hyperlink. Headers shouldn’t be underlined either, they
      should use a larger font and be bolded.\r

      \r


      ## Bullet points\r

      \r

      Bullet points can be used within your products to create lists of
      information or options. However, you must ensure the underlying code meets
      [accessibility guidelines for screen readers](
      https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/).\r

      \r

      Whenever you use bullet points, ensure they are introduced with a
      colon (:) that immediately follows the last letter of the last word in the
      preceding copy:\r

      \r

      -\tThis list is introduced with a colon\r

      \r

      Seriously, don’t forget the colon!\r

      \r

      -\tThis list was not introduced with a colon, whoops\r

      \r

      Each list item in a bullet point list should also begin with a
      capital letter, and should not end in a full stop:\r

      \r

      -\tList item 1 is correct\r

      -\tlist item 2 is incorrect.\r

      \r

      However, longer list items that require intermediary punctuation
      should be finished with a full stop:\r

      \r

      -\tLonger list items break the rules. If it contains a full stop,
      then it should end with one as well so you don’t have a trailing sentence
      that don’t seem to end.\r

      \r\n"
  - title: Punctuation
    body: "## Apostrophes\r

      \r


      Apostrophes are used to denote several things:\r

      \r

      - ownership, i.e. the cat's pyjamas\r

      \    - remember that ownership with plurals comes after the s, i.e.
      the Johnsons' house\r

      - contractions, i.e. I can't be bothered to write the full word\r

      - time, i.e. four o' clock (although remember to read the guidance
      for time in the [conventions](guidelines/style-guide/#conventions
      section)\r

      - apostrophes can also be used to delineate something a bit 'weird'
      in a sentence, where you're alluding to something that is unclear, rather
      than quotation marks (which should only be used for direct quotes). These
      are normally referred to as \"single quotes\".\r

      \r

      ## Brackets\r

      \r

      Brackets should be used when you want to give information that may
      be useful but isn't important to a sentence. However, brackets should be
      brief and should not be a sentence in and of themselves.\r

      \r

      When using brackets, ensure that the full stop is outside of the
      bracket (this is really important).\r

      \r

      Similarly, ensure that there is a space before the bracket(starting
      a bracketed phrase right next to the sentence is very incorrect). If
      you're putting a bracket in the middle of the sentence (like this) ensure
      that there is also a space after the closing bracket.\r

      \r

      Please do not go down the rabbit hole of brackets-within-brackets
      (it looks really unprofessional (promise)).\r

      \r

      Square brackets shouldn't be used in copy, unless you are directly
      quoting from something, or are clarifying a pronoun, i.e. they [the
      client] didn't understand why we used a square bracket.\r

      \r

      ## Colons\r

      \r

      A colon (:) is a really useful tool to introduce something that
      follows it. In fact, it's a requirement! You can use a colon to introduce
      a list, or to mark out something you have introduced. For example, visit
      the Advanced website: www.oneadvanced.com.\r

      \r

      \r

      Here's a few ways to use colons effectively:\r

      \r

      - Only use a single space after a colon, i.e. UX Copywriting: a
      useful tool to making consistent and beautiful copy!\r

      - Words following a colon that introduces something should not be
      capitalised unless they are proper nouns (unless it's the first entry in a
      bulleted list!)\r

      - Sentences should only use one colon: this is because of a few
      reasons: it looks really weird, and you get caught in an endless colon
      spiral: I now have no effective way of getting back to my original
      statement and continue listing the reasons. \r

      - Field labels on screens and forms should always use a colon (i.e.
      \"Name:\" not \"name\")\r

      \r

      ## Commas\r

      \r

      Generally, commas are used to separate sub-clauses in a sentence to
      'construct' a good-looking sentence that is easy to read. A sub-clause is
      a part of a sentence which is slightly separate to the rest, but not
      worthy of an entirely new sentence as it does not make sense on its own.
      See what I did there? An easy way to gauge if something is a new clause is
      to say the sentence out loud. Quite often commas match up almost exactly
      to the natural pause you put in a sentence while speaking, but this is not
      always the case. You will need to use your best judgement for putting a
      stylistic comma in a sentence. Double check with somebody else if you
      aren't sure.\r

      \r

      However, there are a few places where commas are absolutely
      required:\r

      \r

      - List items must be separated in a sentence, i.e. one apple, two
      pears, three oranges and a dog\r

      - After an introductory phrase like \"for example\" or \"however\"\r

      - Separating adjectives that could be switched around or have
      \"and\" put between them, i.e. the beautiful and easy-to-read copy becomes
      the easy-to-read, beautiful copy\r

      \r

      ### Comma splices\r

      \r

      In addition, you should avoid the dreaded \"comma splice\"! A comma
      splice is used is when you use a comma to separate to independent clauses
      from each other. An independent clause differs from a sub-clause –
      independent clauses are related but expand upon the previous clause.
      Independent clauses can form complete sentences on their own. Normally,
      you should use a connecting word like \"and\" or \"but, or use some
      introductory punctuation like a colon (:), an em dash (—) or a semi-colon
      (;). For example:\r

      \r

      The UX Copywriter loves talking about words, it's his favourite
      thing to do. – this has a comma splice.\r

      \r

      The UX Copywriter loves talking about words — it's his favourite
      thing to do. – this uses an em dash instead of a comma.\r

      \r

      ## Dashes\r

      \r

      Dashes are really similar to hyphens but vary in their appearance
      and use. You will largely either use an en dash (¬¬¬¬–) or an em dash (—).
      To write an en dash on a QWERTY keyboard, hold ctrl and press the hyphen
      on your number pad (ensure you have numlock turned on). For an em dash,
      hold ctrl and alt and press the hyphen on your number pad (again, ensure
      numlock is turned on).\r

      \r

      ### En dash\r

      En dashes are used to indicate a range between to values, i.e.
      50-100 words to explain a complicated concept is super unrealistic.
      Typically, this will be used for values, dates and times in your
      product.\r

      \r

      Generally an en dash should not have a space either side of it, but
      please refer to the relevant sections in the date, time and number range
      sections of the [conventions tab](guidelines/tone-of-voice/#conventions)
      for information around spacing with an en dash.\r

      \r

      An em dash is much more stylistic, and is used within copy to
      separate clauses for emphasis — like this! \r

      \r

      Usage of en dashes and em dashes are falling out of fashion, though.
      They're normally considered 'professional' and used very often in official
      publications like newspapers and journals. Grammar is constantly evolving,
      however, and we may see their usage fall away entirely — using a hyphen is
      way easier and barely anyone knows the difference between the three
      anymore. For now, we follow the conventions, but watch this space!\r

      \r

      ## Exclamation marks\r

      \r

      Exclamation marks (!) are used to express excitement, emphatic
      statements or indicate importance. They fit into our tone of voice and
      aren't banned, but use them sparingly. When a paragraph contains loads of
      sentences with exclamation marks, it can get really annoying! Seriously,
      I'm not joking! I'm coming across way too overexcited right now!\r

      \r

      Exclamation marks can be used (again, sparingly!) to emphasise
      phrases in the more informal parts of your software. For example, a
      \"Congratulations! You have new feedback.\" would not go amiss, but \"You
      successfully entered the employee's details!\" would come across as a
      little sarcastic.\r

      \r

      They shouldn't be used when you need to be forceful, such as in an
      error message. Instead, contextual colours and symbols should be used
      instead.\r

      \r

      If you do use an exclamation mark, only ever use a single one. They
      should also always finish a sentence, replacing a full stop.\r

      \r

      ## Full Stops\r

      \r

      Full stops (.) mark the end of a sentence. Use them when you finish
      a sentence, please (unless you are writing something into a table or a
      list).\r

      \r

      Some abbreviations use full stops, but you should double check
      beforehand. For example, \"Mr\" and \"Dr\" do not have full stops, even
      though many people use this incorrectly. If an abbreviation with a full
      stop ends a sentence, you do not need to add a second full stop.\r

      \r

      Initialisms should never have a full stop in them, for example it is
      the \"EU\" not the \"E.U.\". \r

      \r

      ## Hyphens\r

      \r

      Hyphens (-) are often confused with dashes. They are used to join
      certain words together to make a compound word. Some examples of this are
      up-to-date. Correct application of using a hyphen often comes with simply
      knowing whether-or-not a phrase uses them, much like spelling something
      correctly.  If in doubt, you should double check or err on the side of
      caution – you will often find it is a stylistic choice. Feel free to
      hyphenate in your products, but don't fret about missing out hyphens in
      phrases that require them. However, do be careful of using them
      incorrectly to avoid confusion.\r

      \r

      ## Question marks\r

      \r

      Question marks (?) mark the end of a question. Only a single
      question mark should ever be used – similarly, remember that they finish a
      sentence and don't require a full stop.\r

      \r

      ## Quotation marks\r

      \r

      Quotation marks (\") are used when you are directly quoting speech
      or written words. They are also used to delimitate the name of something
      in a sentence when you want to draw attention to it.\r

      \r

      They differ to single quotes, which you can read about under
      apostrophes. Ensure you learn the difference between the two. Single
      quotes are used for emphasis, quotation marks are used for direct
      quotations.\r

      \r

      When quoting something, ensure that the closing punctuation (i.e.
      full stops, exclamation marks and question marks) comes after the final
      quotation mark. If a quotation includes multiple sentences, it is okay to
      include the punctuation within the quotation marks.\r

      \r

      \r

      ## Semicolons\r

      \r

      Semicolons (;) are the most confusing piece of grammar, but
      sometimes the most powerful. They can be used to connect independent
      clauses to add a natural break in the reader's mind, e.g. \"The UX
      Copywriter really likes to use semi-colons; other people are really
      hesitant\".\r

      \r

      You can also use a semi-colon to create really nice looking lists.
      If you want to qualify each item in a list with an explanation, you can
      use a semi-colon instead of a comma. For example: \"He needs some oranges,
      for the fruit salad; a packet of ham, for the sandwiches; a few beers; and
      some crisps.\" \r

      \r

      They are also useful in lists that contain multiple items that are
      paired together, for example: \"Mystery Inc. often splits up into three
      groups, listed in order of efficiency: Shaggy and Scooby; Fred and Daphne;
      and Velma\".\r

      \r

      You do not need to capitalise words after a semi-colon, and you can
      use multiple semi-colons in a single sentence. \r

      \r

      ## Slashes\r

      \r

      Slashes (/) are rarely used, and are mostly just used when there is
      a choice between two things or listing just two related items. Some
      phrases use them, like \"and / or\".\r

      \r

      Normally, we encourage avoiding the use of slashes. They can be
      ambiguous, and often can be worded more clearly. However, if you do need
      to use one to save space, ensure that there is a space either side of the
      slash.\r\n"
  - title: Quality
    body: "## Consistency\r

      \r

      Consistency is really important across your product, and the wider
      suite of products. It really helps to build a consistent identity and
      won't surprise your users with sudden shifts in tone and word choice.\r

      \r

      Ensure that anybody writing copy in your products adheres to the
      (Tone of Voice)[/guidelines/tone-of-voice] guidance, and this style guide.
      \r

      \r

      You should also decide on terms you use for 'common' interactions.
      For example, consistently use either \"Cancel\" or \"Close\" on modals,
      etc. If you're writing something, see if you can find another example of
      something similar elsewhere in the product, or even elsewhere in the
      product suite.\r

      \r

      ## Spelling\r

      \r

      Hopefully this one is quite obvious, but you should never spell a
      word incorrectly in your product. An easy way to avoid this is writing out
      your copy in a word processor beforehand and use the built-in
      spellchecker. Always make sure you check any copy with someone else before
      publishing it – the more eyes see it, the better!\r

      \r

      If you ever use industry-specific jargon, ensure you fully
      understand the context and spelling of it. It will be super embarrassing
      if a user comes back and complains that you don't know what you're
      doing.\r

      \r

      ## Building product familiarity\r

      \r

      A really effective way of clearing out confusion in your copy is
      being clear when something you're referring to is a concept unique to the
      product. When referring to something like this, ensure that you use a
      capital letter to indicate that This Is Something You Will Find In The
      Product. Examples of this includes things like Desks and Applets in
      MyWorkplace. \r

      \r

      This serves another purpose: when words like this stick out of a
      sentence, it really helps the user with on-boarding! If someone sees a
      capitalised word and have 'learned' that this means it's something
      specific to the product, it will encourage them to find out what that is.
      \r\n"
  - title: Structure
    body: "\r

      ## Headings\r

      \r

      Headings are big, bold pieces of text that draw the eye of the user.
      They need to be meaningful and appropriate — if a heading isn't indicative
      of what's underneath it, then it's a pointless heading.\r

      \r

      Headings should only ever be a few words long, anything more than
      three will be pushing it. \r

      \r

      They also go a long way to breaking up the page into logical parts,
      helping the user locate exactly what it is on the page that they're
      looking for. If there are distinct areas of a page, make good use of
      headings to clearly signpost these different areas of functionality.\r

      \r

      ### Subheadings\r

      \r

      Don't forget subheadings! They can even further break up areas of
      functionality into logical pieces.\r

      \r

      They also make the page easier to read for a user. Effective uses of
      subheadings will make parsing the different areas of the page.\r

      \r

      Subheadings should always be at least somewhat related to the
      heading they fall under. If something is entirely unrelated to the heading
      above it, it should be a new heading.\r

      \r

      ## Paragraphs\r

      \r

      Avoid super long paragraphs in your product. Nobody wants to read
      massive walls of text. You will also find that a properly paragraphed
      piece of copy will aid in the user absorbing the information. \r

      \r

      A new paragraph should be used when you move onto a similar but
      related topic or idea.\r

      \r

      ## Readability\r

      \r

      Break up content or pages into logical chunks. Ensure you use
      headings, subheadings and paragraphs to leave plenty of white space to
      give the user's eyes a break. A clustered and cluttered page will make
      absorbing the information really difficult, and users will often find it
      difficult to find what they are looking for.\r

      \r

      White space is really important when reading large chunks of text.
      Imagine reading a book without page borders, and white space in the
      headers and footers. Really hard.\r

      \r

      Similarly, your copy should be easy to understand and unambiguous.
      Refer to the [Tone of Voice](/guidelines/tone-of-voice) guidance for more
      information on this.\r

      \r

      ## Cases\r

      \r

      Cases are super weird! What's title case? What the hell is camel
      case? When should I capitalise a title? When shouldn't I? \r

      \r

      Easy! Use sentence case everywhere in your product! Sentence case is
      like writing a sentence in a book: the first word is capitalised, then the
      only other capitals are proper nouns and the names of your features. \r

      \r

      Sentence case is much easier to read. The advantage of sentence case
      is that pretty much every letter is the same height, and the odd height of
      Capitalised Words separates them from the pack. It makes reading really
      easy for all our users. Sentence case is also just the right level of
      formality that we want to achieve in our software. Our software wants to
      appear conversational, and sentence case achieves exactly that.\r

      \r

      ## White Space\r

      \r

      The term \"white space\" refers to the portions of a page that are
      left blank. This includes things between the breaks between lines in a
      paragraph, paragraphs, headings, graphics, margins, columns, tables, and a
      whole host of other things. \r

      \r

      White space is **not** blank space. It isn't wasted. It is a key
      part of the design of Mosaic. Products that use mosaic are sleek, easy to
      parse, and approachable. Without white space, the page would appear
      cramped, busy and cluttered. \r

      \r

      Conversely, too much white space makes pages feel empty and
      incomplete. Use the space available to you, but ensure you tread a fine
      line between efficiency and visual attractiveness.\r\n"
