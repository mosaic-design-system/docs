## Introduction

Whitespace often pushes important content beneath "the fold", where your users can't see it and potentially miss it completely. From a user experience perspective this isn't ideal. It's a bit like sitting in the pub with a group of friends. Sounds great so far, definitely, but if everyone starts talking at once - you’re not going to take in a lot of the conversation, are you? So, can whitespace and "the fold" live together in harmony?

Okay, let's start with whitespace...

### What is whitespace?

Using the above analogy let’s consider whitespace a mute button. More whitespace equals less noise, making it easier for you to focus on one particular person. It’s not a new concept, in 1930 Swiss typographer,  Jan Tschichold noted:

> “[White space is to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background](http://bobulate.com/post/428787471/an-active-silence)” – Jan Tschichold, 1930

Also known as negative space, whitespace is the empty space around your page elements; buttons, images, links and lines of text, etc. Considered by some to be a waste of valuable screen real-estate, however, when used correctly it’s an invaluable design tool.
