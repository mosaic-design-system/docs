## The "Pyramid"

The approach to UX strategy at Advanced roughly follows the below diagram of sure but steady transition to unification, starting with **visual consistency**. Without a base layer of familiarity between products as a starting point, we will find it difficult to provide genuine *behavioural* consistency of patterns and functionality.

Products are first and foremost assessed by their visual elements i.e. colour palette, brand, font and general layouts of their menu structure and content. Each product is then given a visual consistency "level" that can easily be reported on and understood by all stakeholders.

### Visual Consistency Levels

* **Level 1 - An unbranded application**

  * Essentially a product new to Advanced or that strategically will not integrate with other Advanced products. Its UI is "its own" and does need to become part of the wider Advanced product suite.
* **Level 2 - A branded application**

  * Products that clearly denote that they are owned by and carry the expectation of being an Advanced product. The Advanced logo and Advanced product branding is present, but otherwise the app shares no visual consistency with other products.
* **Level 3 - Part Mosaic**

  * An application that shares *some* of the styles or characteristics of the Mosaic Design System or the previous component set, "Mosaic UI". General colours and fonts may be adhered to, but component usage is piecemeal and not consistent throughout the application. Icons match that of the current or previous icon set.
* **Level 4 - Full "Mosaic UI"**

  * A product whereby 80% or more of its UI elements are sourced from "Mosaic UI" the previous incarnation of Mosaic. Often referred to as "v3" internally at Advanced or the "tri pane" layout.
* **Level 5 - Full "Mosaic UI" Latest Styles**

  * A product whereby 80% or more of its UI elements are sourced from "Mosaic UI", the previous incarnation of Mosaic, but it is on the very latest version which matches stylistically to the Mosaic Design System. 
* **Level 6 - Full Mosaic Design System**

  * The highest level of visual consistency. A product that fully utilises the components and patterns from the Mosaic Design System and can take advantage of themes.
