The following information is of particular relevance to Advanced products and employees, but under full transparency is outlined below for external consumption. Whilst it is not indicative off the full product-by-product strategy for the UXUI space, it hopes to shed some light on the general strategy towards adoption of the Mosaic Design System and other areas of product improvement. 

## The "Pyramid"

The approach to UX strategy at Advanced roughly follows the below diagram of sure but steady transition to unification, starting with **visual consistency**. Without a base layer of familiarity between products as a starting point, we will find it difficult to provide genuine *behavioural* consistency of patterns and functionality. As Advanced is a company that focuses on acquisition and integration to provide fully functional suites of products, a core strategy is align those products look and feel and behaviour is paramount.

Products are first and foremost assessed by their visual elements i.e. colour palette, brand, font and general layouts of their menu structure and content. Each product is then given a visual consistency "level" that can easily be reported on and understood by all stakeholders.

## Visual Consistency Levels

* **Level 1 - An unbranded application**

  * Essentially a product new to Advanced or that strategically will not integrate with other Advanced products. Its UI is "its own" and does need to become part of the wider Advanced product suite.
* **Level 2 - A branded application**

  * Products that clearly denote that they are owned by and carry the expectation of being an Advanced product. The Advanced logo and Advanced product branding is present, but otherwise the app shares no visual consistency with other products.
* **Level 3 - Part Mosaic**

  * An application that shares *some* of the styles or characteristics of the Mosaic Design System or the previous component set, "Mosaic UI". General colours and fonts may be adhered to, but component usage is piecemeal and not consistent throughout the application. Icons match that of the current or previous icon set.
* **Level 4 - Full "Mosaic UI"**

  * A product whereby 80% or more of its UI elements are sourced from "Mosaic UI" the previous incarnation of Mosaic. Often referred to as "v3" internally at Advanced or the "tri pane" layout.
* **Level 5 - Full "Mosaic UI" Latest Styles**

  * A product whereby 80% or more of its UI elements are sourced from "Mosaic UI", the previous incarnation of Mosaic, but it is on the very latest version which matches stylistically to the Mosaic Design System. 
* **Level 6 - Full Mosaic Design System**

  * The highest level of visual consistency. A product that fully utilises the components and patterns from the Mosaic Design System and can take advantage of themes.

Once the visual consistency level of an application has been obtained, a plan can be made alongside product management to target a higher version and an initiative added to the roadmap. The work can then be undertaken with help from the UI Development team. 

Once visual consistency of level 3 or higher has been obtained (ideally 6 wherever possible, but 3 also pertains to applications where latest styling is implemented but perhaps not using Mosaic components for pragmatic reasons) then further work should be undertaken in conjunction with the UX Design team to build pattern re-use into the application. The major functions of the product can be assessed and common functionality and user behaviour streamlined by using repeatable design patterns (for example, file upload, table/grid manipulation, viewing a persons/profile or record,  updating contact and user information etc.)

## UX Benchmarking

Alongside work being undertaken to assess and resolve visual consistency, the UX team is assessing a collective UX benchmark for the products they are mainly responsible for. 

Simply stated, a benchmark study is a deep assessment of an application, with the goal of measuring key performance indicators as a basis for future improvement. Benchmark studies typically have larger sample sizes as compared to basic qualitative or formative usability studies.

The UX benchmark is a score combining a number of factors:

1. The in-product CSAT score from end users
2. The Accessibility score 
3. The Product Engagement Score (adoption, stickiness, retention)
4. The number of support calls of type "user assistance" whereby a user has contacted support purely when at a loss for how to complete a particular function (indicating a complex user journey or lack of training)

These scores are assessed and combined into a single metric (when all sub scores are present). These metrics are then passed to Product Management as another key indicator of where work may need to be undertaken to improve an applications holistic user experience. 

Naturally with any strategy, the march towards continuous improvement is heavily reliant on the product in question, its technology stack, ease of redevelopment and ability to innovate or PoC new concepts to its user base. Overall, any such work undertaken by the product team should be done in conjunction with the UXUI team and its representatives for that products business unit.
