## What is Mosaic?

Mosaic is Advanced's design system: a series of design philosophies, resource libraries and UX/UI guidelines that have been built for the sole purpose of supporting software from its inception, all the way to implementation. Mosaic includes a plethora of tools, guidelines, advice and documentation that can be pieced together to create digital products that your users will love.

## Who is Mosaic for?

Anyone designing and developing a web application! However, primarily for Advanced products. 

## What versions of Mosaic exist?

There are two main "versions" of Mosaic in existence: the Design System (this site) and its UI Components, and the previous incarnation known as "Mosaic UI".

All products using Mosaic for the first time should look to use this site along with the components and patterns created with the latest styling, highest accessibility rating and greater flexibility with JS frameworks. 

Products using "Mosaic UI" should look to upgrade over time, but a version of those components with the latest styling has been made available for use when this is not a pragmatic strategy. Please email mosaic@oneadvanced.com to learn more.
