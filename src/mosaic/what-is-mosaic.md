## What is Mosaic?

Mosaic is Advanced's design system: a series of design philosophies, resource libraries and UX/UI guidelines that have been built for the sole purpose of supporting software from its inception, all the way to implementation. Mosaic includes a plethora of tools, guidelines, advice and documentation that can be pieced together to create digital products that your users will love.

## Who is Mosaic for?

Anyone designing and developing a web application! However, primarily for Advanced products. The guidelines laid out are for use by any web based Advanced web application, regardless of whether they specifically utilise the UI components on the Design System or not. The same theories and research apply, and can be utilised in product design decisions universally. The guidance around accessibility should especially be observed and you can reach out to the UX team for more support if needed on this front.

## What versions of Mosaic exist?

There are two main "versions" of Mosaic in existence: the Design System (this site) and its UI Components, and the previous incarnation known as "Mosaic UI" or "v3".

All products using Mosaic for the first time should look to use this site along with the components and patterns created with the latest styling, highest accessibility rating and greater flexibility with JS frameworks. 

Products using "Mosaic UI" should look to upgrade over time, but a version of those components with the latest styling has been made available for use when this is not a pragmatic strategy. Please reach out to the UX/UI team for more information.

### What is Tessera?

Tessera was a working project name for the new suite of components and has been superseded by the Design System. From this point, these should simply be called the "Mosaic Design System Components". The naming convention Tessera will no longer be used.
